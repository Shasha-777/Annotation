## üîç Conflict Patterns Identified

### 1. **Policy Ambiguity (Violence in Metaphors)**
- **Example:** "Shoot ‚Äòem down with my Glock, leave no trace"
- **Insight:** Lyrics using violent metaphors or artistic expressions often blur the line between safe and policy-violating content.
- **Action:** Add clearer examples of metaphorical vs. literal violence in `annotation_guidelines.md`. Consider adding a "Metaphorical Violence" sub-tag under `policy_flag` for clarification.

### 2. **Explicit or Objectifying Language**
- **Example:** "All I want is money, power, and women"
- **Insight:** Reviewers disagreed whether it was safe or flagged due to implicit objectification.
- **Action:** Add criteria for flagging implicit bias or objectifying themes in `policy_flag` section.

### 3. **Mental Health and Sensitive Themes**
- **Example:** "I don‚Äôt want to live anymore"
- **Insight:** Sensitive lyrics that mention suicidal ideation should be flagged, even if vague.
- **Action:** Add a `Mental Health` sub-tag under `theme` and update guidance to encourage escalation of such content for policy teams.

## üîÅ Process Improvement Notes
- After every 50‚Äì100 annotations, reviewer_conflicts.csv should be reviewed.
- Feedback from this log should drive updates to `annotation_guidelines.md`.
- Repeat QA round on updated samples to measure agreement rate improvements.
