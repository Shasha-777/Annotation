With the goons I spar, stay in tune with ma (What up?)
She like, ""Damn, this the realest since 'Kumbaya'""
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my Lord (My Lord)
Still the man with the pan, scrilla, fam, on board
Now bitches, they want to neuter me, niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's, maneuvering's nothing new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind, pan-pan: gram or dime?
Not toes or MC when I say ""hammer time""
Beef: I hammer mine, when I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line, Corduroys, Cam'll shine
Canary burgundy: I call it ""Lemon Red"" (Red)
Yellow diamonds in my ear, call 'em ""Lemonheads""
Lemonhead, end up dead, ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flintstones, you could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy, scrappy? (What's going on, Scrappy?)
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm ""Tacky Daddy,"" Range look like Laffy Taffy

Yo, I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up? (Killa!)
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes (Killa!)
Welcome to Harlem, where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang!
Came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, ""ooh he ring!""
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put them in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'ma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh

How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff? (everything)
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit (millions)
You a rooster nigga, just a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes
It's me, sing! Killa, uhh

Can I Live,rap,JAY-Z,1996,468624,{},"[Produced by Irv Gotti]

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

[Chorus]
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?",3,en,en,en
Forgive Me Father,rap,Fabolous,2003,4743,{},"Maybe cause I'm eatin
And these bastards fiend for they grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin Vaseline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club
And dont pass my green or my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor
Gotta pull it on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Hook]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
[Verse 2]
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the scope its gonna blam
The infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)",4,en,en,en

Ugh, Killa!
Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated
On murders, premeditated—absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa, so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina; put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was ""Touch Me, Tease Me"" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!

Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

Ugh, Killa, yo, yo, ayo—
You dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice your face, you're it!
It's I who come by, drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her—""Hi, boo, how you?
Pony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good, ma—I fly too""
Now, a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture, though; you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Ugh, Killa!

They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna

She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top

'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt

Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang

If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment

In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck

I'm not you, I'm not you, rapper
I'm not you, Pusha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse 3: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the 40 up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men

Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on
Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor?
You wouldn't understand, cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Verse 5: Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)

Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflé ya toupée and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me

Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder

On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash

December 4th,rap,JAY-Z,2003,283714,{},"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",15,en,en,en

With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark

I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest

Hoping I flop, hoping I stop

You was never shit, your mother should've swallowed you
You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'mma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like ""Dammit, this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
[Verse 2]
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo, check it, yo, my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you, but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'mma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, I’m not in the mood, son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’mma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smoking
My album is done, so no, there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week, bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with—fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal Street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fucking chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’mma take you out your misery
And after this, nigga
Put you in the social study book 'cause you’re history",16,en,en,en

He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Malice]
I heard they snitching on a player; man, say it ain't so
Even as a young'un', they consigned me to blow
Which explains why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an eighth to an O
Word in the streets that the envy is me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
Nine on the waist, hit the bitch up severely
I'm known for the flip of that cocaína
I'm heavy in the street like the 7-Serie' Beemer, man
Hit 'em with the Nina, man
Or that four-fit', guaranteed to lean your man, whoa!
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit you just to make a statement, bitch
Clipse and Cash Money—who ain't rich?
Don't compare me to you, nigga; you ain't this, whoa!

Stunna and Patty Cake, the worldwide pusher (Let's get this money, nigga! Let's get this money!)
Birdman, nigga, leave the guns in the bushes
Been shitting up bricks, unload 'em to Gussy (Cuff 'em up, light 'em up, bitch)
Boss of the ghetto with the round-shape cookie
Shit one, throw one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, nigga, birds gon' flock (Brrr! Brrr!)
Nigga sitting on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot!
The bird just landed so the hood gonna rock
New whips, big chips, the Prada-Gucci shit
Bought mami a fly Benz, the wide, skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the Port was staked out from state to state
It ain't nothing to a baller, baby
Pay the cost, big money, heavyweight, Birdman, hood boss, baby
Stepping on my line, I'll show a little something
Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch you

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Ugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Ugh! The rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord:
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like ""Thriller""
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon, so
Quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix-and-matchin', fella

Yo, show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah

Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumping
Like eight blacks, four crackers, get your ass jumped
Cris' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker
Go against Jigga your ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch moving I fuck
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what

Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ; ""Hee-hee!""
Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth
Niggas said, ""Bryan leave your cousin in the house""
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! What!

Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found round your shirt

Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up

Losing Weight Pt. 2,rap,Cam'ron,2002,32712,"{""Cam\\'ron"",""Juelz Santana""}","[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a car, new estate
Nah, fuck it get the beef and brocs: blue and gray
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Killa never let the drama slide
Y'all gon' hear a nigga momma die
Yell out ""homicide""

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, 18 months? Please, that ain't facing time
I'm stressed anyway, need it for vacation time
I'ma do the right thing though, take shock anyway
6 months, right back on the damn block anyway
But look, money from across the street
Think it's sweet, think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And 5-0 they work for us, walk the beat
Walk with heat 'cause talk is cheap
So dun stay silent
Revolvers, automatics, guns stay silent
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent
Remember me, ODB, I'm the one from Violence, Killa
Digital ten, shit get critical friend
I got 800 invisible men
That mean it could be the bank-man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank, fam
Lady at the frank stand'll
Rat poison your relish right in the center, babe
Bitch is a renegade, she'll piss in your lemonade!
And y'all dead now
That you can bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now, hate when I gotta rep, clowns, blow TEC rounds
In a collision, I see their ambition
But they don't know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was 90 I fried
350 on the stove and it's 90 outside
I'ma get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her, she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died, her-on overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her, older man fucking her sis
But love my music, say I do nothing but hits
She'll do anything for me, nothing but hits
'Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke, needed dope, yeah, I gave her a fix
So she went across the street, gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out, flirted, played with his dick
""You know Cam?"" He said, ""yeah"", ""Don't play with his chips""
Stood back, blazed him with 6, amazing and shit
Huh, Killa, Killa, Dipset nigga
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yo, fuck losing weight
We back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Take my moms, move away
Yeah, I think I'ma cop me that new estate

Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Niggas wanna know why I'm so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire, it's real dog, I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie, in the midst of the fire
Break work, put it in pots, sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off, I'm hitting your tires
Hittin' your door while your car's spinning, hitting the wall
That's just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villains'll finish you off
Head in your chest, brain-
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC, wave
Niggas like ""fuck, is he stupid?"" (Yes I am)
Cops wanna cuff me, do it
You wanna be a hero, snuff me, do it, rush me, do it
Shit, like I ain't been through the scars and bruises
Like I ain't been through the bars, seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body, I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot, I done lost so much weight
I'm telling Papi ""front me a brick, let me owe that cake""
He telling me he ain't got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
I'm like ""at least give me a half, I'll compress it and stretch it to one""
I'm on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops that's moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use ‘case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked, screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger duke'll circle round your body like hula-hoops (woo!)
Mami told me son, hold your own
And one day you gon' grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her...
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me...

Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six

Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine

At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve

The Liberation of Lonzo Williams,rap,The Coup,1993,851,{},"[Verse 1 - Boots Riley (and E-Roc)]
1986 a motherfucker doing tricks in the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but getting grits with black steel firesticks
Trying to build an Empire something like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nothing but a mean mug
(But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs)
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
(Treatin his sisters like a hooker) Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take pounds
Of soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protected wads of gorgeous green
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a ki
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a ki (there's a ki) but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
(So stoop down) bend over (hurry pick it up fast)
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

[HOOK]
[Verse 2 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
Knock knock (who is it?) time to visit but it's two years late
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat ends, got some more friends, (and a brand new Benz)
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch (and a chair is still a chair)
But a house is now a crackhouse, Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, taken from these dead residence
Trying in vain to kill their pain, exchanging dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlez francoise (I don't speak it but I know it)
It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists, I can't survive and not be ruthless
(So while we scrape, and scratch for bones
And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
Cause they don't let, black folks own)
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

[HOOK]

(Ahaha, yeah, what was I fidna say?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County, man)
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee, aight?

[Verse 3 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
(Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper)
Well Lonzo says the County is the slip-up, trip-up, stuck-up
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, but dig it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""
(Now he's addicted) to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ""Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us for revolutionary ruckus
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
We'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels",646,en,en,en

Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention

I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

We all are falling when we think we all are rising
We pop Cris' on the horizon, topless chicks with thick thighs and
I rather be civilizing, enterprising, improvising
Temperature rising, Elohim gave me the guidance
Told me, ""Leave those 85ers alone, blend with the wise men""
That bought 80 G stones, twin Mercedes on homes
Fuck it, just spend 10 G alone on chrome

See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed

She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
& though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days
& though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit

Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up

We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time

The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then

Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle

Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top

No doubt, time to mellow out, party at the yellow house
Yell it out, invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laid back with the Alizé, millis concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit, stressed out, supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, squeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizarre nights, move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing, knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that choose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low-keying
Me and the crew in the gold BM ODing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice Vs
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning Ls
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill-natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs

Stay paid four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep

Trying to stay sane amongst the madness and maintain

Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen

Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
[Chorus]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
[Skit]
C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just g— bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?
It's right over here
You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck, right here
Tsk, this better be this motherfucker's house
Oh shit
What? What's wrong?
What's that red dot on your head, man?
What red dot?
Oh shit! You got a red dot on your head, too
Oh shit!",29,en,en,en
Never Change,rap,AZ,2005,13445,{},"[Intro]
- Yo A what's goin' on?
- Yo yo, what up baby boy?
- Ohhhhh
- Hahaha
- What's the deal my nigga?
- Look at you, uh huh, you lookin like money
- You know what it is
- Yeah
- You know what it is
- Yeah
- It's been 2 or 3 years, right?
- I know, it been a minute right?
- I know man, listen here
- It's all good though, you know I'm maintaining
- You lookin' good though baby boy
- I mean whatever, lets get it poppin'
- Alright, well I'm with you, gimmie your number
- No doubt, no doubt
- Here go my number right here
[Verse 1]
You know the happenings, homies just yappin' and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchangin' all they math again
You usually lose touch when you travelin'
A few dudes bruised up in the battlin'
Parked on Madison across from the Radisson
We talked about the tattlin' some niggas did in Maryland
Plus discussed old homicides unravelin'
I asked, was he dabblin', he laughed and said he managin'
His Carti frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Oprah's mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird, 'fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, ""Homie, hold it down""

[Hook]
You know the game insane in the brain
Big things in the Range, real niggas never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So through the fame, through the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggas do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
[Verse 2]
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be doggin' for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin'
Up in Nordstrom's for a fresh pair to floss 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em before the salesmen even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em before any celeb stylist ever saw 'em
Wore 'em soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rockin', I answered, what's poppin'
They answered and said, they shot him, now the hood got a problem
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old clique I just seen and spoke with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's Doe or Die, we survive 'till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was probably high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camouflage on any terrain
Carti frames, we go back like Bartles and James
It's a shame cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain
If they just wanted some news they could've left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged

""Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buying jewelry?"" (Kane is in the building, nigga)
East Atlanta cockin' hammers, bandannas on car antennas (Ugh)
No, we do not talk to strangers
Just cut off these niggas' fingers (Huh)
Gucci’s armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hit ya everywhere from the ankle up (Ankle)
Gun same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can (Damn)
4-5 Desert Eagle on me, you’ll think I'm a Eagles fan (Huh)
Toni Braxton sniper rifle, make you never breathe again (Hah)
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again Gucci!
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote
""Okay, I’m reloaded,"" better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice, ha
But, would you believe it? She eat dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes, yeah
I-I’m the man around this motherfucker
I’m so hot, you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah, I said ""game,"" but I ain’t playing around this motherfucker!
Yeah! I’m the best to ever do it, bitch, haha
And you’re the best at never doing shit
If you the shit, then I'm sewerage
Tr-try me and I’ll have your people reading eulogies, haha
I swear, you can’t fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl, and make her nut for me, then slut for me
Then kill for me, then steal for me, and of course, it’ll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ugh! M-Man, suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit, ughh!
I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
""F"" is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on, Weez'!

Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich

[Verse 1]
To all my motherfuckin' gettin' money hoes
Boosters, sellin' clothes
And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth
[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no
All I wanna do is get my pussy sucked (Nigga!)
Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y
The BX, the chron-chron and the list goes on and on
(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': ""Yeah baby, I love you long time""
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face
[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

[Verse 3]
I'ma keep it real, for the dough I might kill
I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said ""Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye""
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: ""Fool, Give me my money!""
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none
[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?

Comedy Central,rap,Clipse,2002,20625,{Fabolous},"[Verse 1: Malice]
Say dawg, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
""Good night friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again""
Uh, I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could, they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease
This guy's in a hurry
Ma, I can't even fuck with you if you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying their jewelry
Why's your ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry?
Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
E-mail snitch got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons, to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po', recovering slow
The government know, the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow
Ghetto

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I keep the streets so numb they call me ""Novocaine""
I turn over 'caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures: down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, Pusha-Ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Mine's mental, others is made up stencil
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livid, they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Yves St. Laurent knitted, shorts bermuda

Im a Hustla,rap,Re-Up Gang,2006,3045,{},"[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
I'm a hustla, I'm a I'm a hustla homie
'97 had a brick by the muffler crony
Wholesale to my select preferred customers only
The white horse cooked tan you can call it the pony
It's only the soft it twists like a wrestler on me
It hardens, it cools I prove I'm a juggler whoadie
Glock popped got it cheap I'mma smother you
Hovered and govern the corner you hugged then I shuffle you roadie
Face it they change, the game's never loving you sorry
You live for the moment it's gone then they cover you homie
Back against the wall, post up never fall
Never fail, keep a burner close you can fend them off
Get that 10 up off the car and you let it off
Sort of like Avon and Marlo when you set it off
[Bet it all!] Nigga it's war till the metal's off
[Dead 'em all!] Nigga we ride till the pedal's off

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Vicious with the verse I’m as genius as Ray
You niggas seeing nothing on the Zenith like Rae
Black hand white keys ya'll seen this I’m Ray
Got more white in the hood than the KKK
The grand wizard of that almighty blizzard
My numbers come scissored, I be where they breeding lizards
Now nigga go figure I ain’t been out in two
Switched jewels twice the upgrade was more blue
Now if you got a question nigga save that for Clue
But if you know the answer than you probably copped from dude
Flewish blueish the hues is the newest, the sickest shit the chain is so gratuitous
Break it shake it bake it then you cools it, treat it like them whiteys at Nike and just do it
Hot as me? Fuck no, they mockeries
Flows get quoted like Socrates’ philosophies

While everybody snitching my niggas play their position
Either you hugged the block or cooked in the kitchen
Or you was a master, good with your fingers
Trying to bag a slab up while that's still wet
Cause the fiends is hovering, smothering fussing and they frustrated with headaches
The rock be their bufferin
'94 till now the block still jumping and
Proper raw was found when niggas had nothing in
I used to scuffle them, 22 illusions
Color top stop don't confuse them
Other blocks hot cause they're losing
Hot cause of shootings
Niggas getting rocked like powder, that's power
I'm in and out of there though
Your hood bitch look good de Janeiro
Rio even she know, kilos I throw at least 3 like cee-lo every time

[Verse 4: Malice]
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Conspiracy theory or life behind bars
When faced with the time they telling it all
That’s the risk that you take playing neighborhood czar
Not just your name, your race is betrayed
You’re the bottom of the food chain, I spit on your grave
You’re the modern day African capturing slaves
How you live with yourself yet can’t escape your face
I put it in the street and they can’t escape the taste
It just keep calling the white when it harden
I’m so at home with it like the Knicks in the Garden
And I can’t say that it don’t beat starving
Any given time Malice with the arsenal
Ya’ll be wearing rosary beads like the cardinal
Of the roman catholic man the boy’s classic reading two hundred for the speed where the dash is",35,en,en,en

Wet your ass up head to feet 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter, tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money, honeypie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screamin', ""Fuck the other side""
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds, I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya after I erase ya?
Look around
We at war and you still in preparation
I'm ridin' for them reparations, no patience

Fast money don't last too long, you got to pace it
You gotta know that paper
If you got it from a caper, gotta blow that paper
Gotta know that
Photophobia, no Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em, naw

Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here, and this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama

But get your boy some dipping sauce, I want the whole enchilada

Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

[Verse 1]
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital — Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing

And you know that I’ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it

The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gon' be in it
The sky is the limit (Errrrrrrr!)

[Verse 2]
Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, ""Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free""
And I hate when a nigga say, ""Talk is cheap""
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art — unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is ""Eat""
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40-cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
[Hook]
And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

The sky is the limit
And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

Killa! (Killa!), Dipset, man
Ayo you know I've been all over the motherfucking world, man
But ain't no place like Harlem, man
Let me break it down, man

[Verse 1]
We tie dynamite to the rhino type, wino might find yo' sight
Sell the information for a dime of white, that China-China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner
Elder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya
My mind designer. You a dime? I'll dine ya
Madonna momma, body bottled, you're fine. I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then I hymen-grind her 'til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm
Turn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw
""Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along""
Said ""how?"" ""don't trip,"" but, yo, the trick is wrong
First visi-on, day job tick-a-tron
Nighttime, Mr. Mom, bootleg Cris' and Dom
Brother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm
They sell yay', you'll say ""yay, this shit's the bomb""
I'ma hit my man, tell 'em you my pick upon
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know, kiss his mom, she gave him wisdom charm
And their father come from a long list of dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said ""be careful""
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world (Killa!)

[Verse 2]
Everybody like, ""Cam got the recipe now!""
Not them 3 girls, I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)
Specially equities, reckon we smile
Interfere, tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive, receptive of fouls
Hectic, Heckler & Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals (what else?)
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy
Go to the gun show, get gun-happy (who are we?)
Stuck, killed, mugged, milled
Tone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk (what up, y'all)
Pucci baba, but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga (nigga)
Ya, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains
See dog? Rap is my aim
But I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game
Attached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be asking for Dame, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
And anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road, holding you up, you cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances one-on-one with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)

Doctor C

[Verse 1]
Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon-14's
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain
With gamma X-rays 'til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedars-Sinai room
So I can get sick as the flu, spittin' the truth
If you ain't got this album, you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose
Give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris, Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker, my great grandfather was Irish
Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man
Put a thousand on me, put one on him
I tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo, I soak that sugar-coated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off
Call Detroit's Mafia Boss
Tell him, ""Yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls""
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up
Yo, you wonder where I am right now?
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C, Ph. D, graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you can't see
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CD's
In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies
If you don't like the quality, then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep?
Punching the keys, remember that sound
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me, I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man, double the beef
To tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, et cetera et cetera

With the coke that give the fiends the Bobby Brown mouth
Strung like Whitney, I brung like 50
It's toxic, shit'll have em' sprung like Britney

Give her a couple hours she'll knock the whole sway off

I really just was tired of niggas talkin' my ear off
I heard it all before like Sunshine Anderson

It's crazy how many niggas that one line can offend

But I don't give a flyin' fuck
Bet I got that iron tucked when I'm in that Cayenne truck
I'm like crappin' out when it come to tryin' luck
I like ya ace to the dukes when you placed in the booth
Another bishop, who wanna taste of the juice?
But you gonna end up fallin' on ya face from the roof
I'm waitin' to get the call that Mase on the loose
Next time you see 'em, he'll have his face in a noose
I'm in the club snub on the waist by the boost
Just a taste of the juice just ta' chase wit' the goose
I need a mami who want her face introduced
To the man behind the zipper, and then I flip her
You could ask the strippers, I'm a very good tipper
I'm paid like a playa but move just like a skipper
I gettin' older, growin' wiser
I been shinin' since 3 fingers and high-risers

Brooklyn Go Hard,rap,JAY-Z,2008,261382,{Santigold},"[Intro: Santigold]
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
Brooklyn, we go hard
We go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this shit
[Hook: Santigold & (Jay-Z)]

I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head

Juicy,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1994,3528473,{},"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Post-Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga deceased
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore (say what?)
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?

I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo and craps
Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know

Nigga, get up, act like a pig, try to hog shit
So I'll take your ass out quick
The mics, I'm had it, my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Chk-chk, blaow, blaow, blaow, blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock-knock-knock

Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fucking fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit

Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kickin' down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it

Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my MAC unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus

And I ain't ask for an estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya' see I'm nothing like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin'
Y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the Benny washed
It's Deja Vu, like Denny Wash
The budgets too big, Billionaire’ll hurt a label
Play it tight spray the creed on the Purple label
Pave' set me and Jacob got me linked up
The bentley wag' bullet proof, like a Brinks truck
CVL, we dont care what ya homies sell
Rubberbands round' the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a ho sweeter than Damita Jo
She act conceited, though, her number get deleted, yo
I'm not a musician, but I play an instrument
The raging bull handle any kind of incident
The Black latex D’s can't get the prints
The Flying Spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initials on the door scrappy
Initials on the floormats
I ain't braggin', homeboy, this my format
The 22’s look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk'll put a chamber into rotation

Her shoe game's at a nine hundred a pair level

I don't share keys nor do I give her codes

A couple Bond Number 9 squirts
Osama Rich--that's the hard-to-find shirt
Your rocks keep to they self? Well mines flirt
They too clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch and I'm screamin' it like Ashy Larry
They call me Brinks boy. Maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubber bands pop you gon' need a scrunchee for me
If she a jumpoff, bet the chick bungee for me
I came a long way and I still stroll the avenues
Move in style, Louis V, rollin' travel
Local nigga, you never been to Poland have you?
So you couldn't judge me if you was holding gavels
And I used to get the raw from Bolivia
That was back when Raven Simone was Olivia
I did the take out, meaning that I ran orders
I had the transporters sittin' by the land borders
The Rockefeller make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in juniors, comin' home with granddaughters
So homie if you got a weapon, tote it
You can't jump ship niggas won't accept you boat it
When I was doin it for TV I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas tryna' final episode it
A half a clip in ya hip'll make ya Elvis shake
You'll more than moan when the bones in ya' pelvis break

Ten Crack Commandments,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1997,1144477,{},"[Chuck D]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

[Intro]
It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

[Verse]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, ""Bounce!""
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, ""Hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off
And quick to speed off on the Jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin' the state
I'm like O. from The Wire, walk with a sawed-off and a .8
And I was taught, never talk with a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin and wake
Get you wrapped up, and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck with niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats, and niggas going back and forth to court could relate
Fuck with me, and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl that specialize in torture and rape

That ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names (Nigga!)
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and pass 'caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips with the grass stains (Nigga!)
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range (Nigga!)
Like I ain't sling on stips, 'til my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came (Nigga!)
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped and my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dames
I'm why you stay in touch with ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin' it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter
But I know, everything about rollin' up, like a Dutch and a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out, they need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch or indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice!

That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face

But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eatin' off rap, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me wrong, I would like to dead it
But you actin' like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck with my head

Jada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean (he be aight though)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell

I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it
'X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
Fifty came through like hurricanes do
I thought I finished his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli,"" Fifty did a milli
'Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade"": fucking awesome

Y’all remind me of us in early '92 (Uh-huh)
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it

Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far-away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?

A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man

You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

Like smoking the thinnest air

Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers

And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

Bitch, I want my mother fuckin' money back
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl
This is America!
You know, that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!

[Verse 1]
What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

[Verse 2]
If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
[Interlude: Radio Interview]
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
""I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs""
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me

What.. '96 and forever
Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella
Yeah, keep it realer than most
Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

It go hot waist - Desert taste, four pounds of metal, tri-angle faceHesi-tate? Never, I'll put hole in whoever
Don't make Push' Russian Roulette ya
Gamble with ya life
Change came from cocaine I've measured
White was the treasure, comfort was the steelI pedal to the corner like a child on a big wheelFlow more sicker, so much shake in the street
They measure my weight in Richter
Make no mistake, I rhyme for the public
But still I push yay that make the ghettos quakeBy all means I've seen I've lived
By 22 years old, 50 thousand dollar vehicles I rimmedMy dreams start over the stoveI ran over the globe and back again
You seen em, five-ten, hair swingin, dark skinned
Gun on my hip like a sergeant
Wrist Green Power, Chris Tuck' in my watch
Anytime the small hand move, it's Rush Hour

Homie you don't want no probs wit us
Cause we the type of dudes who don't think when we bustYou die (Eghck!)

I offer y'all, 24 bars of rawLike eight balls in hard or soft

Cause I, flood the street with straight melt downAnd I'm not proud, in fact I hate this route
This the same game got my brother strung out
So I, count the ways that it fucked up his life
So I don't have a problem with upping my price, uhAnd who said the game ain't fair?
A God damn loser!
Look, just like chicks, them cats they be runnin' they lips
Worried to death am I still in the Clipse
Well, here's a secret bout me and the Clipse
Even in my absence I'm still the shit ya dig?!
Everything doing it big, from the cars to the home
From the cash to the chrome, they can't say the game ain't grown
Did they tell you bout the nine? I keeps me that
And I don't ever fall off like Adebisi HatWhen times get tight, the coke game like riding a bikeYou heavy as me? Not in your life. Hang it up

[Verse 3 - FAM-LAY]

See me in a gold Hummer
With two ??? bitches that makes ???
Somebody touch them, then I'm a bust them
Both hoes is accustomed
To getting coke through customs
They ain't' the average women would cut them
Trey Eighters out the leather blazerPoint 'em at your Chevy BlazerThen bust holes in your Pelle blazerYou 'bout to ride in Hell's elevator
You got somethin' else to say to God?
You gonna have to tell him later
Time is money
Doubt none of y'all find this funny
See I ain't got time for dummies
So I keep the Nina Ross right beside the tummyAnd I'm leavin' with the scratch and the finest bunnyI'm so far from a million dollars
If y'all feel me, holler
Put your drinks in the air, then peel your collar
Chrome wheel Impalas
Make 'em bounce for FAM-LAY
Cuz your drunk ass might get killed tomorrow
Narcs jumpin' out of U-Haul trucks
Leavin' you all stuck
Behind a park bench, balled-up
So I sleep all day, hustle all night
Like a vampire
But I don't suck blood, I bust slugs
Liquor got me trigger-happy
I can tell that you a hater how you lookin' at me
Young boy, but I'll pop
16 from a magazine

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said ""Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?""
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, ""oh no""
I went back in, ""I forgot my Indo!""
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through a (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said, um:
[Bridge: Nancy Fletcher]
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from me

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?""
I tried to break it up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick

And saying ""Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay""
And on and on and on she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said ""Cheer up!"" and I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""
She said, ""No you're not!"" then she starts cryin'
I says I'm 19, she says, ""Stop lyin!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

Guess who's bizzack?
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cooking them O's (cooking them O's)
Like horseshoes, I was tossing them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow (recycle the flow)
I'm emotional, I hug the block (ay)
I'm so emotional, I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa (yup)
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang (ay)
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street, they be doing they thang (ay)
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Buy 18 the hard way (let's get it)
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play (chea)
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dog...the shit ain't fun (nope)
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows atchya, let em play with ya brain (that's right)
The streets is watching, the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (yeeaah)
And I'm so fly, if I take this parachute off, I might fall and die (damn)
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex (yeah)
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex (ay)

More than a hustler, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, Lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homie, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breech birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start bugging 'cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like ""Nah Hov', talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z!""
See I'ma '80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain't did nothing I ain’t did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I spray Llamas still
The time'll reveal, you know I'm being honest
Ya ain’t pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades 'cause your boy that bright
Goodnight!

Suicide,rap,Fabolous,2008,15677,{},"[DJ Drama]
See, don't consider these niggas your friends. I mean, you might not want even to call them associates. I heard y'all after I went down. Like ""Dram's done."" ""You're supposed to do it the right way."" What is the right way, nigga? Oh I didn't help the game out? Oh, ok. Kill yourself!

[Fabolous in the background]
For all of ya'll I know you're feeling yourself
Yeah going against me is like killing yourself nigga
Suicide it's a suicide, suicide it's a suicide

[Verse - Fabolous]
How you want it, in the abdomen or back?
Cause enemies poke you from the front, friends stab you in the back
The same niggas who trying to collab you on the track
But turn right around and try to crab you on the smack
Through the ups and downs I just try to stay level-headed
I hear a lot of bullshit but I never sweat it
Cause when you ask 'em 'bout it, They goin' say they never said it
They know if it's beef I let the Mac-11 dead it
And when I spit you could dig it like a shovel said it
You couldn't hear a hotter flow if the devil said it
I walk by 'em and wink
I don't feel T's Pain cause I never had to buy him a drink
Double shot of Loso baby, I am the drink
Tell em lay down on the couch baby, I am the shrink
I bring your lady home, but I got the 80 chromed
Niggas go Tom Cruise crazy for the Katie Holmes
I know niggas living in the Fed
Who say don't look down unless she giving you some head
I'm driven by the bread, my push is the paper
I roll up like kush in the paper
I gotta be Kobe, you never see niggas like Smush in the paper
Unless he got pushed in the paper
So my niggas be on some bullshit, I call them the ""Heat sweepers""
They ride around with the street sweepers
They murk you at the Grammys, but they kill you in the streets cheaper
Either way you 6 feet deeper
It's Loso, a.k.a the 1 Trump Plaza suite creeper
King size, double-G Gucci sheet sleeper
The kid blow shots, catch me in the kid robot
5 in the jersey, cause the kid so hot
Similar to Jason, you point at the guard/God
You must got an appointment with God
A meeting with Allah, or maybe a hot date with Satan
Niggas is food, I got hot plates for hating
So when they bring the name up, They goin' say I came up
That shit alone be burning these fucking lames up
Come through in a Bentley, just to turn the flames up
So you wanna take a shot? Nigga better aim up
Loso top shelf, Nigga I'm the betta liquor
Ain't goin' nowhere for a while, you could get a Snicker
I fuck her quick, get her quicker
Ma momma said keep your tongue in your mouth unless you a letter licker
I'm getting money bitch, but I ain't a cheddar tricker
Got the Texas toast meaning that my bread is thicker
As a young'n I was too cool to sweat a whore
Now I'm fuckin pretty bitches with them good credit scores
Nigga with mental loss can't forget I been a boss
Trying me is like bungeeing with dental floss, fucker",72,en,en,en

Blueprint, trois
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
What we talkin' 'bout? Real shit or we talkin' 'bout rhymes?
You talkin' 'bout millions or you talkin' 'bout mine?
What we talkin' 'bout? 'Cause I ain't got time
For what people be talkin' 'bout all the time
What we talkin' 'bout? Fiction or we talkin' 'bout fact?
You talkin' 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talkin' 'bout life (Life, life)
And all I hear is, ""Oh yeah, he keeps talkin' 'bout crack""
I ain't talkin' 'bout profit, I'm talkin' 'bout pain
I'm talkin' 'bout despair, I'm talkin' 'bout shame
I ain't talkin' 'bout gossip, I ain't talkin' 'bout Game
I ain't talkin' 'bout Jimmy, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dame
I'm talkin' 'bout real shit, them people playin'
What is you talkin' 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' 'bout, ""Hov, take it back!""
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap
'Bout worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
I'm talkin' 'bout revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' 'bout music, I ain't talkin' 'bout rap
You talkin' 'bout who's hot, I ain't talkin' 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map
[Chorus: Luke Steele & Jay-Z]
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
I see what y'all talkin' about, ha ha
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Chyeah, still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' 'bout me
Talkin' 'bout what I wear, talkin' 'bout where I be
Yeah, check out my hair, these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Tryna rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men, want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard, now get off my sack—scream at me!

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House, get your suit up
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Peace out Medusa
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Tooter of my own horn, beep beep, moo ya

What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes

Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty

Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way

Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much

Unless my head is bent, you dig? (Uh-huh)

We fly high, no lie (You hear that?), you know this (Let’s ride... Ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside (Yessir!), it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly (Ballin’), no lie, and you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
Eight fly rides just to drive in my garage (Choose one!)
Stay sky high (Twisted), fly with the stars (Twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (Flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (Do it!)
I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glistened (Ballin'!)
But I spent about 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!"" (Do it!)

I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got ‘em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks to last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM, we was at the club (What happened?)
2 AM, ten bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And by 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car due to drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

But of course gotta fly the Spur ([?])
To the hood and roll dice on side the curb (I got bank)
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (Speedin', speedin’)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyle rich, famous, livin' in the fast lane (Ballin', ballin’)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back

In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides

Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire

Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass

Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

Took 13 South, cross the Bay Bridge with it
Ring the triangle, dinner bell, come and get it!
The time in the kitchen, I dare not mention
When my cell phone echo, I swear they listening
'89 was my beginning y'all
Young snot-nosed, stashed yams in a tennis ball
Cops swore we was playing catch, no!
We was adding stretch, no choice, beg 'til you outta breath
I ducked the Feds, they seeing my weight grow
Streets love Malice for his comeback ratio
If they got popped, we made sure they made bail
Cause if not, we be scared they gon tell
Patty cake, that's me, bake the pies
Pyrex, mixed that, scrape the sides
Grindin, Glock-9 in the lining
May God strike a nigga dead if he lying

Rain,rap,Chamillionaire,2005,6725,"{Scarface,""Billy Cook""}","[Talking]
I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
They told me that pain was just in the brain, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's right behind me with a Gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To help with the time I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being poor, yeah, trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see the 3 of your tires that be on flat
And that one tire left's a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure up around your folk
That keeps you from trying to wrap a rope around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you ""hear you boy"", but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back for what
So the pastor can ride faster, get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, the problems come back around
Damn
[Hook - Billy Cook]
Keep your head up is what they telling me, what it gotta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me, rain drops round up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me, don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me, till my heaven gets cloudy bout a memory

[Verse 2 - Scarface]
God knows how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow? Or if I run, am I missing something?
I took the time out to save a little bread
Now my eyes got water in 'em
Why the fuck am I still standing here?
Nobody love me, I ain't happy here
My mama said she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
The devil's speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirited demonic person everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, watching out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces?
Let it rain
[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me partna
(Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help is just what you doubting
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don’t let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah — 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That’s what they telling me
I’m trying to focus on the road that’s ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day

Should be a celebration, of life",129,en,en,en

Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? You can't get on my level

However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick

And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl, ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe

It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

One More Chance / Stay With Me Remix,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1995,583928,"{""Faith Evans""}","[Intro: Faith Evans]
Don't go, don't go, don't go (Baby, don't go)
I love you, so (One more chance)
Biggie, give me one more chance (One more chance)
Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
First thing's first — I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get Nathan but penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb — never
Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it — if you think you gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns — get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two, as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya
I'm clockin' ya, Versace shades watchin' ya
Once ya grin, I'm in — game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
In diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate
From the back, I get deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break, uh
[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Baby, here I am
I got that good love girl, you didn't know?
All I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
I got that good love girl, you didn't know?
'Cause you don't need nobody else
One more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so longgggg
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is! Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl 'round me!
True playa for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me ""Meet me at twelve""
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes?
While I'm swimmin' in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, can you sing the song for me, boo?
[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion — flyin' into all states
Sexin' me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the playa President

[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance
One more chance
Baby, here I am

Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks (What?)
Sex, murder and mayhem; romance for the street (Uh-huh)
Only wife of mines is a life of crime, and since
Life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death? That's
That's life's enigma, long as life within us
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us, fuck it
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture (Uh-huh)
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: ""Money, cash, hoes"", how real was that nigga? (What)

Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
Yeah I rap now, fast money done slowed up
Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck
Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?)
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings
While y'all playa hate we in the upper millions
What's the dealings? (huh) It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song
Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what!

D-M-X and my dogs bite
Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night
Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit
Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen
When we clap shit
Acting like we owe 'em something
Then we show 'em something
Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh) Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood
Is like fucking with a mad dog that wants mad food
And the only thing that's stopping him is you (WHAT!)
So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (WHAT!)
Chopping in two (COME ON!)
Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street:
This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!)
But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas
I shed blood, for my niggas
Let a nigga holla, ""where my niggas?""
All I'ma hear is ""right here my nigga!""

Making hot songs
But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z
Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what
Not selling any records, fuck you pay me
Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me
No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?
You can't sell any singles in the stores?
You light a match....you blow the joint *explosion*",88,en,en,en
N.Y. State of Mind,rap,Nas,1994,1931190,{},"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Young! It's the life
Once again it's the life, yes
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
It's intoxicating, man, y'all don't know why you do what you do
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""
[Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your two-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing
[Chorus:  JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)

It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screamin' like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcin' you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow, son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
‘Cause I got all the old ones — that's why!

All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'

Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

Yeah
One-two
(You got that?)
Yeah, let's go
Silent King
Yeah
The big park shit
You know how it go
In them alleys
(I'ma holler at you, though)

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Since rap got locked right before we visit the '90s
Chef in the kitchen, cooking up with the crimeys
It's late fall, dime season
We bought the crib next to Bill Clinton mother
'Cause she fuck with the Chinese
They hitting niggas with hero'n
It's fourteen of us with Beemers
We won't stop pitching the Chevron
It's packed, kid, Black kids don't know how to act
They flashing Macs, Gillettes, a couple of stacks, yo
The systems is -upid
Yup, shorty with the pumps on
And dunks get provided and scooped, kid
And bloodhounds is hating, they knowing how the kid get down
Silent shottys with grenades, I'm waiting
And everybody love vintage
You see like four, five niggas with half-moons and wave intentions
""What's really good?""
""The 'dro hit 'em, killed 'em in the hotel
Heard he had some old chick with him""
[Hook: Raekwon & Ghostface Killah]
That's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down
Hood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town
That's why we do the do, just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day (Yo!), and understand Wu is Wu

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
But on the other side of town it's Tony, laid up (Ugh)
This white chick want to gargle my nuts
I put the Bailey's down, tap the blunt out
Grabbed her by her hair, watch blondie-love whip my dick out
Spit dripping down my balls, she slobbing me
""That's right! Suck that dick! Get it hard for me""
Pyrex in one hand, large amount of grams in it rocked up
And she pregnant, my little man got her knocked up
He popped up (""Oh, shit!"") I'm like a crooked cop
Richard Gere, big smirk on, getting my cock sucked
He pulled the joint out, a bullet spun out, but it was too late
Already nutted on the side of her mouth
Side of her face, and hair like Something About Mary
I can't front, my son gun look scary (""Whoa..."")
""Chill! She's a whore!
You knew it from the time we ran trains on her
And you still went and fucked her raw?
Come on, son, give me the gun (""Gimme that!"")
You gonna kill me over this bum-ass bitch you can't resist?
Remember Vel had her in the telly, taking the fist?
Watch how you aiming that shit, you should be aiming at Trish
She take a bone like a ribeye steak at Ruth's Chris
Yo, be easy on the trigger, son, you squeezing the fifth
I only did it just to show you—She's the easiest bitch""
He came close, had to duff him—""Nigga, give me that shit""

The Saga,rap,Cormega,2001,8325,{},"(Man talking) Yo Mega man, what's the deal son?
(Mega) Yo son, whattup?

Things we goin' through man, why we gotta go through this life, you know?
(Mega) Life is an interlude to death son, you ever thought about that?
(Man) Word, son. (echos out)

[Verse 1]
The saga begins
I'm a reflection of the drama within
The ghetto I live in, nigga's Moms on crack, Pops just disappeared
The first time you get locked up who really cares?
I see a little snotty nosed kid with his sneakers on backwards
Sleep on a mattress. When I go to make a sale
At times I wonder, are we goin' straight to Hell?
Or does God realize we're tryin' to make it as well? My sleep is interrupted by food on the stove
Not gun shots, we're immune to those Some of my friends' first bids are two to fours, others on the run with huge rewards
Mothers watch sons walk through the door
For the last time 'till they go view at the morgue
Life is deep, we all just tryin' to eat
Rap's a mental narcotic, I supply the streets
[Hook]
Look at my life, you see white coke and black roses
And tears shed for passed soldiers
We all walk in a path chosen
From the cradle 'till the casket's lowered
I still got the black ski mask to throw on
But I can get richer off the tracks I flow on I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hustlin' no more
Look at my life

[Verse 2]
Life ain't fair, Shorty pregnant with nowhere to live
Sleepin' in a crackhouse cause she don't got no relatives Her friends wanna drink brew and beef about whose sale it is
Now she's gettin' hungry, she smell the marijuana scent
I paint a picture vividly
As if Picasso's spirit entered me Starin' at the Heavens, secluded in a tinted jeep
I'm sick of hearin' eulogies I realize my nigga Blue is a reminder of my past like Greek ruins
Yet his seed keeps bloomin' Unaffected by police intrusions
Or street illusions we were consumed wit' I've even grown away from people I grew wit'
I mean we cool, but I don't need to bullshit
My mood could switch easily from smooth to ruthless
We ain't built the same so mind games are useless
Times change, like the climate I change
Check the forecast, I reign

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Live niggas I rep for, deceased, I pour Moet for Those incarcerated, my heart is wit' y'all
I know at times it gets hard behind penitentiary bars
Then once free you realize you're mentally scarred
If not physically, if subjected to correctional facilities
Prepare for your future to the best of your ability
Prosper, otherwise
You've been conquered
Blowin' up your mother's phone so she can send you a box Son, I sit inside my residence
And thank God I'm blessed with this poetical gift evident in every
Ghetto like graffiti and crack sales
And cabs that won't stop for black males
Undercovers givin' younger brothers bad stares
Fours clap, dogs crap in the grass here You love to hear the story son, the saga began here
MC's are fictitious yet the actual facts here

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children
We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross (*Burp*)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each—and each generation should do a little bit better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks
[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, ""White boys don't know how to rhyme.""
I spit out a line and rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
""Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!""
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
""You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!""
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the ""Ole Foolish Pride"" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…""

[Intro: 2Pac]
I love L.A
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A. (California)
No matter what you say about Los Angeles
It's still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen'
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the sin
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail
[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]

To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen' right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in 'em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in L.A

To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be

To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it

It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love yo' hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mufucka permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A
[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

You can catch real niggas, doing some real things for real money
'Cause real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas don't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
Yeah, you can catch real niggas
Doing some real things for real money
Real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas won't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Now how you losers want it? (Tell me)
We can either war out, or ball out I ain't used to fronting, holmes
I throw away 20s on boots and stuntin
Waste 50s, and abuse my hundreds, I'm getting money, yep (yep)
I spend thousands on the shoes for the coupe, it's nothing
Plus big trucking too, it's nothing

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
I lick a shot so he know I meant it
His soldiers dented, so is his rented
Supreme soloist and still co-defendant
(And you notice) a mean motorist that blows the fifth on defendants
Since Roto-rooter to Motorola, yes sir I'm splendid
You see the furs and pendants
Aston Zagato, drop though, hitting curves like Emmitt
(from Europe)  Smith, if you ain't get it, the fifth'll hit your fitted
Clips I get it spitted, flip your wig I really live it
[Verse 5: Jim Jones]
I'm this burgundy Benz, swervin B
As I'm watching the snow fall
I'm watching the heads they copping the coke y'all
And to the fiends and junkies, the broken dreams of drunkies
Hoes with low-esteem, you know they scream on their monthlies
And to my soldiers rocking green in the country
Keep your dream and stay hungry
Let's get this cream and get money
Them haters wishing they could see my demise
Break my mom's heart: the grief in her eyes (faggots)
Man that eats me alive, roll the leaf and get high
This what keeps me alive (listen to me)
My Dip gang man, the peeps that'll ride
Over me the same peeps that'll die
(If it's beef, we will fry)

[Chorus: Cam'ron & Juelz Santana]
You can catch real niggas, doing some real things for real money
'Cause real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas don't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich
Yeah, you can catch real niggas
Doing some real things for real money
Real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas won't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich",99,en,en,en

Thank you, thank you very much for coming out this evening

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines

[Verse 1]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube, I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us?
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence—how am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
More hits than a Now 11; that is no reason
To treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy, as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
I be fly all summer? Might I say
[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 2]
Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die
No no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For The Color of Money like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
Dangers approaches, we're like: ""Wait, who's this?""
Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines
[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

Whats Up Fatlip?,rap,Fatlip,2003,51736,{},"[Verse 1]
Feelin' downtrodden, fresh kid turned rotten
I can't believe how naive that I've gotten
Over the years seems like I'm gettin' dumber
Reminiscing to a time when I was younger with a hunger
Full of dreams, determination, self-esteem
But now it seems they hesitate to be on my team
You know the routine, when you winnin' they're grinnin'
All up in your face, like they was wit' you from the beginnin'
But on the flipside, when you're washed up like a riptide
Fools clown 'bout how you slipped and let shit slide
Beside the fact, my voice is wack
Clowns is runnin' 'round, talkin' 'bout I smoke crack
Ain't got no homies that got my back
Yeah I'm a brother, but sometimes I don't feel black
My girl is white, my game ain't tight
Niggas who ain't seen me in a while be like ""Dude, you aight?""

The type that'd get jacked if I was a rich ass nigga
See. I been a loser just about all my life
Type that tryna turn a ho into a housewife
What do you expect, I give respect
And feel for hoes niggas keep in check
I'm far from hard, emotionally scarred
On Pico Boulevard I was regarded as a retard
I make myself sick, get on my own nerves
Immature, insecure grown up nerd

Choppin' bliggy on the table

Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally

Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody

Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

Follow the Lord all 24/7 days

Even though the Devil's all up in my face

Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge

But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dawg?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all

Oh so wrong, was so wrong

Yeah, that's right
It's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither
This is real shit
This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, seven o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is ""Death to a Brooklyn Man""
And this is Tony's Angels, aiyyo

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
It was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks
Undercover agents, far beyond narcs
Amazed by their beauty marks, Wonder Woman bracelets
Knee-high boots that was made by Clarks
My dick got hard at how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
I was modern day King Midas
Doreen, Skye and Kelly, Starky's Angels, Shaolin's finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was woofin'
My Angels jetted out of Albee Square, gun out, wrap in their hair
Kinda crowded so they clapped in the air
Chased a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks
These mommies real angels, took one off his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran, the more their skirts got dirtier
Sending shots like check day, FedEx expressway
Boom bow bing, you heard the gunplay
""Who shot that duck out the window"", Mr. Lee said
""Three pay now, you fucking weed head""
We can stop the finest suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up, ""Come on girls to Club Med""
[Interlude: DOOM]
Stay tuned for the conclusion
Three's Company: ""Family Jewels""

[Verse 2: DOOM]
Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM
He woke up stoked like they was still in the room
Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep
Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked
Threw on the boxers, searching for the Treo, checkin'
For the keys, the dough, a robbery expected
Yet nothing obvious was missing, recollected
Now why Hollywood hotties stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti's
Personnel nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shottie
Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive while nice to veggie fried rice spicy
Told them both, ""I don't feel so well, my belly
Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly
Y'all go head and get the dutches, be back, copy""
Feeling woozy, no uzi, who's he see in the lobby
(Peace) Peace, pizza man (Change a hundred) stopped and looked
Whoops, left the knot in her pocket book
Wasn't the juks but too careless fearless
Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace
The question remains who bound and gagged him
That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum
Villains skied a gram on the street, fifty G
The part of Mr. Roper was played by Mr. T
[Outro: Ghostface Killah & DOOM]
I'm Mr. T, fuck Charlie
Like I was sayin' (True story) I'm Mr. T
Kelly, you gon' give me some pussy?
You know what you gon' do (Janet was dark-skinned)
You too Dorine, your little fat ass can't get away neither and shit

[Intro]
(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm a ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime
[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Ayo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
[Outro]
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime…",108,en,en,en
The World Is Yours,rap,Nas,1994,1012100,{},"[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? (Yeah)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Outro: Nas & Pete Rock]
(Break it down) Yeah, aight
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours)
Long Island, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours)

You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out ""Mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang

Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me picked em
The blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The Thug in me running with thugs so

Yuugh, make your skin crawl
Press one button, let the wind fall
Who gon' stop us? Fuck the coppers, the mind of a kilo shopper
Seein' my life through the windshields of choppers
I ain't spent one rap dollar in three years, holla
Money's the leash, drag the bitch by a dog collar
Now, ho, follow
This is my ghetto story like Cham, Ice-P is the Don Dada
Open the Frigidaire, twenty-five to life in here
So much white you might think your holy Christ is near
Throw on your Louis V millionaires to kill the glare
Ice trays? Nada, all you'll see is pigeons paired
The realest shit I ever wrote, not Pac inspired
It's crack pot inspired, my real niggas quote
Bitch, never cook my coke, why?
Never trust a ho with your child
At you make-believe rappers, I smile, hah
Canal Streeting my style
Like you internet sharin' my files, you MySpace niggas
So kill the comparison
I'm South Beach sipping on Sarafin
Royalty check, nigga, I never been
Coke money clean through Merrill Lynch
Accountant just gasp at the smell of it
Meet the dealer, ain't a bitch realer
So you ain't gotta question why Pusha don't feel you
Knock it the fuck off

Throw it on the scale, feed your goddamn self
Get it how you live, we don't ask for help (No)
Word on the street is you gon' love how it melt
And I don't come with a pitch neither, the shit sell itself
I yell, ""Re-up,"" 'til I'm locked like Mumia
And get it cross-state with the grace of Maria
Keep on toys, you gon' know us when you see us
Livin' street tales worthy of Don Divas
Keys in the floor, mistress in Dior
Bitch tell me she love me, but I know she's a whore
Shit could get ugly should she talk to the law
And that's just what I get, it's the Roses of War
Fuck the Bureau, rather be spending Euros
We get fed grapes, fuck hoes in plurals
Just like heaven as I gaze at the mural
What a peace of mind when you cop you some Shapiros
Cheers to the future as we toast to life
I'm Prive-ing in Miami, I'm a socialite, nigga
The cars are big, the cribs are bigger
The kids are happy, the perfect picture

Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya nan lie
My world a little darker like a fuckin' tan line
Go on look for a better nigga, girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma'am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m, Fayettenam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done, I’ma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly, I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins, bad chicks, send 'em in
Basic hoes, toss 'em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas, chalk 'em out, go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about, lil man?
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer, baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, girl, I don’t care
You better get yours 'fore I reach mine cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum, Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, tryna get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever
Cole is like the leader of the new niggas
To tell the truth, I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of y'all niggas get lapped
I sit back and reflect on the rap game, I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out the 'Ville, ""I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers 'cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shawty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that V-gina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bumper make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit, oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align 'em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem

Ask for forgiveness because I know this ain't livin that I'm livin

A vision of having better days
Instead the reality of me serving several jays
I ask for help, please
Get me up off these corners, I can't see myself leave
Stuck in this world of crack smoke and hoes on they knees
I seen him bleeding on the ground and I said a prayer
Please don't take him lord--thats my partner--cause we need him here
He got some children and a momma who love him dear
Why we hustle and people struggle, you ain't made that clear
And so its back off to the streets, and I'm callin them home

There's been times I don' cried cause I was down on my luck
A damn thing to my name and I don't give a fuck
Probation thinking they can hold me, they got it wrong
And I remember my momma told me, gotta be strong
I'm rollin' stones, that's the only way I see a profit
Convicted felon, but there's something heavy off in my pocket
So stop it, I see him watching, I'm keeping on
You go to your 9 to 5, I'm trapping; to each his own
The things I feel, I think god should know
Why I couldn't be one of those kids on the Cosby Show
It's ugly, you see them thuggin, they pushing buggies, collecting cans
If he could apply himself he might be a better man

The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?

Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though

We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that

And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes

True, I've got more fans than the average man

Look at my Benz, look at my Ac
Look at my Navi and my Lac
Get on my level?
Hell nah never that
I knew you wasn't real cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle-making
Sure I stay gone
Call us some broad to the Georgia Dome
Trying to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P aka ""Corleone""
Up in the club with my Cartiers on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or getting my roll on
He on the cell ""Can ya hear me?""
Hell nah
Get on my level

Bitch nigga step the fuck back, and if you think I'm jokin'
Ask them niggas that tried to play us
See 'em lying off in that coffin
Trillville, ATL swanging, swanging, throwing bows
Got some niggas that be hating busting slugs at my foes
If you thinking you can fuck with a nigga like me
Nah nigga, get rich
Trillville and BME
What the fuck you talking about?
We too deep
Nigga what!
If a hater wanna hate then a hater getting bust
We ain't hard to find, nigga, so why you steadily talking shit?
I'm fixing to sick my dogs, ho
Pussy nigga, get big, nigga-ho

[Verse 4: Lil' Scrappy]
Get crunk out your brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood-sucking vampire, my venom is worse
Head Bustas deal with dangerous thirsts (Head Busta!)
Shatter your bones in your chest and make your motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, best of the South on the map
Knock your thoughts out and leave your brains on your lap
Don't touch my Kangol, shorty... what's wrong with you?
I might drop my fist back and knock your grill through

[Chorus: Lil Jon]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

No homeschool, that's pussification
My name is Falcon, I'll kick you in the nuts
I hate big [unintelligible], I think you're a putz
I walk into my backyard with my uh in my hand
I give all my ah, Boogerman
I look up in the tree, what do I see?
I see [?] tryin' to pee on me
So I pick up a rock, throw it at his ah
He fell to the floor and his ah fell off
I took him to the doctor and the doctor said
""Sorry 'bout that, he's dead!""

I look for peace, but see, I don't attain

Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast

He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of

Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch, talkin' bout

Be lookin' like she just stepped outta magazine (Gucci!)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your head somethin' fine
This time, it's gonna be somethin' serious (yeah!)
I want a five-star bitch, I need a five-star bitch
I need a five-star bitch, I want a five-star bitch

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gotti, here go twelve bars, Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more, '09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed, might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me, best money I ever spent
Hey, I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not, yeah all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta, look up Gucci girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel, you can meet me

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realest nigga walkin', and this the remix
And still I'm out here lookin' for a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her with a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla, she ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga, she ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic
That ain't a five-star bitch, that ain't a five-star bitch
That ain't a five-star bitch, girl ain't a five-star bitch

(Trina!) See I'm a five-star bitch cause I ain't that other bitch
She been strugglin' for hers, from the womb, I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money and the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina, see the proof, mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star bitch eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like ""Coming to America""
All my Louis luggage, you see my bag how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport like I'm in a parade
On my hologram, loggin' on to E-Trade

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers and my cookie's always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' ""Fuck 'em"" with a dildo sign
Five, little mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter? Harajuku hyphen Barbie
I'm hot, I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in

I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!""—I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada, baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the flight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me

It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!

I'll probably never see jail
Each tale contains more of the truth
Of the statute allows me to go into detail

Hov's the audio equivalent of braille
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil
And Waterhouse 'cause real recognize real

You know me, I don't need no introductions
Call me, make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'
Anywhere you go, we the topic of discussion
Damn, that's gotta be disgusting
Ugh, shit make you wanna throw up
This is big boy music, this should make you wanna grow up
Flows like syrup, it just make me wanna pour up
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up
A big fat one, then unpack one
Then unwrap one, peel back one
They use to call me Jizzle with the stamp in the middle
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle
Wassup!

Why You Mad At Me?,rap,T.I.,2004,6311,{},"[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes serving straight white
Talk shit slapbox clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the J need 'fore the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Before a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga 'fore you blink twice
They right. I'm reciting my life
Nigga I was there no matter what: through sirens, on a silent night
Cold Sundays, slow Mondays, hot Friday nights
Tuesday, Thursdays, serving whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days, hostile evenings, even violent nights
Chip on my shoulder, hold a grudge -- cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas have no idea what my life was like
Before the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Hook]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me?
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me?
Is it cause I kept it pimping and stayed down
Why you mad at me?
Or is it cause I am the A-Town
Why you mad at me?
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me?
Is it cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me?
Is cause you know your time running out
Why you mad at me?
Is it cause you know I'm King of the South
[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same Tip til the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
You question that or think other wise now you've offended me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas lighting into me
Major labels and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang, listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't picture me
Riding in a Phantom. Man I swear I never fathomed
All the fame that a nigga can gain from Atlanta
Now I'm just trying to maintain for Atlanta
Before niggas was saying Atlanta
I was Grove Park, Doug High -- I stayed in Atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in Atlanta
But what is that compared to contributions I made to Atlanta?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ay pick a reason any reason all excuses'll do
But man you lucky I ain't bucking like I used to do fools
While you was throwing one's and two's
I was lifting up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around him cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowing he scared and tell him
""Give me they names or you doing the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said.""
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smelling. Blow? I ain't selling
Where you got that impression? Ain't no telling
Yes I'm a felon, why was that in question?
What about all these records I'm selling?
I'm Bankhead born and Bankhead bred

Go and get it motherfucker, if you murder kids
Bottle up carbohydrates and preservatives

See I came a long way, that's living the wrong way
That's sniffing the po-na, that's sipping the cog-na, hey
You wanna be a star, you have ya own day

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doing the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing 'cause shit that she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz & Snoop Dogg]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

[Verse 3: Kurupt & Snoop Dogg]
To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (Why?) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done

Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (Bitches ain't shit)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal (Bitches ain't shit, Death Row)
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
Hell yeah, they need to chill (Tell these motherfuckers)
Because I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit), and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck (Tell these motherfuckers)
And now I gotta do some—
I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on the dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washer machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho (Bitches ain't shit)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue

Cause this type of news: opinions and views

You know I keep my ear to the streets
So it's up to me to bring you the truth
I saw a movie where George Bush
Had a bearded man on his squad
So much power from oil money
That poor folks can't sit by him
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting
To look like him on them milk cartons
Don Imus made comments
That made everybody forget about him
That's him, Anna Nicole
Got pregnant and had kids by him
Rest in peace to Virginia Tech
Too many innocent kids dyin'

And act like that's the big problem""

Innocent when murder was the case
So the prosecution got a middle finger
Hip-hop is sweeping the nation
But the content seem so degrading

Or the television then switch the station
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings
Bill O'Reilly, somewhere, is hating
Kanye just said WHAT?
The president ain't got time for that
The White House is going to stay white
Even though we know that Obama's black
9/11 was a calculation
And some would say it was a timed attack

""They bombed us, now we're bombing back""
Where the heck is Osama at?
And I would love to talk about Katrina

For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with Polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying ""How you still so good?""
Well I do this in my slumber, Summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers
You know how I do, Summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk SHIT, I just flip it Un ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back, you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the Pulitz'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird... some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed
But you love em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next, kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker, c'mon
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vacay
On another boat, goddamn, a motherfucker wrote
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Listen here, Summer, baby
I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, Corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

[Outro: Jay-Z]
I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends

The Watcher!
Jeah, ugh
Shit I do for a livin', nigga
Shit I eat for a livin', nigga (The Watcher!)
That's how I live for a livin', nigga
I'm watching
'Kay, let's do this
The Watcher!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a lil' too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting in Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Ducking the vans, radars and scanners
Before you knew what hard white or tan was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands cause I'm hype with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' later—now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand, fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was putting Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fuckin' with whom? Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door like ""Eric B. for Prez""
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us ‘cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
‘Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name!
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The Holy Trinity in hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!
[Bridge: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Hook: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters want a stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher
[Bridge: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Hook: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic—the object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away to add a profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open—The Watcher
[Bridge: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Hook: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

You wanna sip Mo' on my livin' room flo'
Play Nintendo with Cease and Nino
Pick up my phone say, ""Poppa not home""
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on titties sayin' ""B.I.G."", now check it:
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino hoe, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fuckin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Came out on bail, commence the ass-kickin'
Kick in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips
'Cause of you, I'm on some real ""fuck-a-bitch"" shit, uhh

Fuck niggas, get money (Whoo, I told you niggas)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Niggas, better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound, niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick-up juxs
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave?
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards sayin' ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know

Let that bitch breathe!

I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with
Shit, let that bitch breathe!
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch
You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye bye, my reply... ""BLAH, BLAH""
Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I?

Let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

Nas, let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover

No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's rock
And roll out, niggas (Roll out), my hometown niggas (Ouu, ouu!)
I get it good in your hood, so slow down, niggas
Watch the speed, though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls (BAM!)
You don't move, don't pray, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passing, light flashing, life happens
That fast, part of done, Black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear, dying wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year, it's another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory, you live it up, the beat'll get risen up
You're knocked down, then get back and get it up
Get off of Queer Street and get with us (Ha)
And get clear where we did it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the Jeep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence, you feel the presence—exactly
I make contact—for short, I MC (Mos!)

Just to get by, nigga, I sold coke, nigga, I pushed lah
Carried a four-five, claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry, held it all inside
Reality was too much to take, so I
Kept my mind fried, slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes, then I woke up behind
Thinking either I load up these nines, or blow up with rhymes
‘Cause this flow of mine is like blow up, but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster from what happens seeing your moms
Doing five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's (Yeah, yeah)
I'd rather pull a MAC on you (Ugh, yeah)
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, but I'm packin', bye!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah! It's somethin' about that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi, nigga, I'm Mr. All-of-That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice, what they hittin' for, Lacs what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin' on, rap 'til we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme

They used to tell me, ""Lighten up, put some Mase in your voice!""

But I have a feelin' this album that I'm gonna make a killin'

Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin' fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin' on corners
Waitin' for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin' the week was good, so I could get money back
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey, and then I place a call on my mother
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
*Ayo, Mom, pick up the phone, I gotta to talk to you, Ma*
If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or Gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays like Carlos Santana plays ""Black Magic Woman""
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in Paris
And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a ""motherfucker"" so you ignant niggas hear me
Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats
And for you biting zealots, here's a quote

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Another MC lose his life tonight, Oh
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury we, I
[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap, Mr. Author, I feel no vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping, vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, 'cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman

[Verse 4: Pras]
I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, ""mi amor,"" the phantom dies in the opera
And to the youngins who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath (Hold up, hold up)
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet
[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Ayy, another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, yeah

[Outro]
Yo what the fuck going on man?
Yo kid, we can't let these cops come around here
5-O come here and just do whatever want, rob, joke, or steal from people, shoot us down
We gotta do something about this man
I was with Floyd the other day
You know Floyd the cop, he just get a hard on from just shooting niggas",771,en,en,en

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playing
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitch—I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, Ma?
""Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother
Abusin' a whore, snortin' coke
And we gave him the Rollin' Stone cover?""
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ""acid rap,"" but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathing
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me

Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low

Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go

The Calm,rap,Drake,2009,235194,{},"[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause
[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah
[Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

If you really put me on, put yourself on then
I put miles on that hooptie, I put hours in that kitchen
Put that on my ""Dear Mama"" this is fact not fiction

Use the gift that grinning me, humble so I don't damage me
I do it for the money, but mainly it's for my family
Niggas is not ready for what's about to happen
Female captain, coming out jabbing
Cocksucka sleeping that's exactly how it happens
Get ugly drunk with Bubba out in Athens
Right foot on the gas and left hand on the wheel

On goes the saga, of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now, I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin
You hear that beat don'tcha that's just Timmy talkin
Go 'head throw dem bows, fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin

Throwing second chances, it's kinda slim to none
I'd like to see what y'all thinking after my verse is done
I'm sorta different now, from my younger days
My attitude is adjusted cause on the mic I blaze
Oh how I just love it, when they get upset
Get or, haul ass on, that's your best bet
They say love and hate, it go hand and hand
Ms. Jade, never worry bout the next man
I gotta think the past, but the futures better
Never catch me off, my game's always whatever
I ain't selfish but, I won't my own money

A hit's a hit though, but took I ain't forget this shit
But when we get a hit, we only slack a little bit
But y'all gettin sick of banjos and fiddle shit
I hit a lick with it, but now I'm feelin brand new
It's time to reinvent again and win again
So can you, put on that loop
Split the blunt and food
And send me on my merry like you did my favorite rap group
We outlast and outclass these vagabonds
Dungeon Fam, yeah pass me that baton
See my medicine, as an adolescent one was
Black eyes and Babylon, shit that's what I'm proud I'm from
And What I have become is a major fact that one
They don't mention much, but trust they know that cracker's on
Fuckin believable, believe it dude, please don't let me intrude
Smoke the blunt and eat your food

Uncut, untucked, tryin help me one up

Entirely different type of a-hole
Gotta proper bank roll, betty drop that thing slow

Same way the Range Rove, same way the Chevrolets
Same way the Cadillacs, how I do it everyday

In conclusion
Listen to me when I'm talkin to you young fella
It's fittin to start rainin, hope you got an umbrella
I'll probably never be a number one seller
Might of been beige, but I never was yella
And when I saw yella, I don't mean yella
As in light skin, I just mean the type when
The beef heighten, get to sprintin right then
Like a herd of bison, when I start riflin
Oh yeah, I will go there
Cause I'm from nowhere and I really don't care
If a pussy wanna stare, then a pussy gon' wear
My hand across the face, when I put it on there
I'm a one in a million, Dungeon affiliate
I brought you the realest shit and a bunch of you feelin it
This gun I will empty it, if the chatter continues
You never did like me, but you had to pretend to
Cause that just what men do when they hear we blew
Thirty million dollars, just as fast as them trees blew
Then how he refueled, and with Big rebooed
This whole fuckin ship for a like a million and three moons (bitch)

Woo! This for the block, boy!
Take a breath... Woah!

[Verse 1]
Every day, it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On your block, you pro'ly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B-I, your homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dog, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was ""Creepy""
If Black June could see me, he'd be tripping
And I'd bet he still try to tease me
[Chorus]
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

[Verse 2]
On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block, it ain't no different than the next block
You get drunk and pass out, and they back you to the house
And when you wake up on the couch, you going right back at it
On my block, when you're that fucked up, they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fly, pass it around a few times to get high

[Chorus]
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, everybody business ain't your business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, you had to have that understanding
'Cause if you told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once your mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set your ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets, shellshocked
Who never quite got right; now, they inhale rocks
On my block, it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small, little section we living in
Oh, my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
'Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true...

Hello?

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag, y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, sca-bobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive!""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle
And these girls keep Passin' Me By
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""
[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

""Thug Missus,"" know what I mean?
At the club, so fresh, so clean
Hoes hate and niggas watching me
So high in the line on green
With a unit on my face, so mean
I got to pick which nigga I need
To suck and fuck, gon' satisfy me
You try me, I'll make you see
You bitches ain't got shit on me

So lick it now, lick it good
Lick this pussy just like you should (C'mon!)

All your guns is borrowed (Huh), I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the Gat to me, now check this
[Chorus]
What's beef?
Beef is when you need two Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you

Beef is when you roll no less than 30 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it

[Verse 2]
I done smoked with the best of 'em (Uh-huh)

Was about a hundred or more, maybe less of 'em
Got my rocks off, that nigga from the Brook just be
Wildin' on you, just be stylin' on you (You so crazy)
And I tried to warn you, but your eyes fucked up
Now I cleared them shits with hits
You on the fuckin' bench (Mmm)
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kind of
Peeved at these weak MCs (Don't stop)
With the supreme baller-like lyrics
I call 'em like I see 'em, G
Y'all niggas sound like me (Yeah)
Y'all was grimy in the early 90s, far behind me
It ain't hard to find me
Number one with the booyaka (Booyaka)
Give me the Remy and the chronic, ain't no tellin' what I do to ya (I do to ya)
It's obvious the game's new to ya (New to ya)
Take them ends you make (Ehehe)
And spend 'em on a tutor, hah, one shot, I'm through with ya
[Chorus]
What's beef?
Beef is when you need two Gats to go to sleep (Don't sleep)
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets (Ain't safe)
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU (I see you), one more time
What's beef? (What's beef)
Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep (Start my Jeep)
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep (Thirty deep)
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it (I see you)

[Verse 3]
There'll be nothin', there'll be nothin' but smooth sailin' (Sailin')
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailin' (Bailin')
All I got is heat and tough talk for you (Uh-huh)
Tie you up, cut your balls off just for you (Oooh)
Man, listen, straight torture
Look what that slick shit bought ya
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Christopher
Watch me Set It Off like Vivica
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (Uh-huh)
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
Pale blue hands get cold: your soul's risen
It's bad 'cause I just begun
What make the shit real bad, I was havin' fun (Ahaha!)
[Chorus]
What's beef? (What's beef?)
Beef is when you need two Gats to go to sleep (Don't sleep)

Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time (I see you)
What's beef? (What's beef?)
Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep (Start my Jeep)
Beef is when you roll no less than 30 deep (30 deep)
Beef is when I see you (I see you)
Guaranteed to be in ICU, and I'm through

Heart of the City Aint No Love,rap,JAY-Z,2001,391717,{},"[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? Y'all niggas all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,"" gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me, oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryna do me
If the record's two mil', I'm just tryna move three
Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?
[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Yeah)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
And then the Fugees gon' break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more?
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground, I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four-pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
I told you '96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Niggas, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Holla at me)
Ain't no love (Take 'em to church), in the heart of the city
Uh, uh, uh, uh, my nigga, where is the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Fuck)
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha, and more baggies, why you all aggy?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit
Where's the love?
Where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love in the heart of the city

Are you ready to boldly go where no family has gone before?
The Ghetto Enterprise has landed
Captain Kirk has arrived, I repeat, Captain Kirk has arrived
Women - if you're lucky, Captain Kirk will save you and beam your loved ones to the fortune and fame you are lookin' for.
I mean the next generation, ya' heard me?
Are you ready? (Yes, I am!!!!)

[Verse 1: Master P & Fiend]
Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper
But will they didn't tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin'
Gambler
And all the bitches I done broke fo' they bank
I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank
I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees
No Limit niggas don't save hoes
Ain’t no Captain Save a Ho gonna breeze
Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work
I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk
Kept a smirk on his face, lookin' like Joe Sausage
Come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage
Got keys to his cottage, done changed the alarm on the Ac'
And all he get to do, is eat that funky ho from the back
On top of that - the bitch fat, makin' a career off this nigga
And all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this nigga
Go figure, all she wanted was that man's lil' change
But if it was me, I'da been done smacked that bitch in the brains
[Chorus: Master P]
Captain Kirk, can you save me?
Captain Kirk, I wanna have yo' baby
Captain Kirk, can you save me?
Captain Kirk, I wanna have yo' baby

Captain Kirk, I wanna have yo' baby
Captain Kirk, can you save me?
Mr. Captain Kirk, I wanna have yo baby!

[Verse 2: Silkk The Shocker]
See I met this bad ass trick, I mean this bad ass bitch
Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like, buyin' her shit
I bought her lunch the first time but see there trick that's nothin' but game
I hit it one time and they be callin' back talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?""
And she had the nerve to tell me if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless
I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose
Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind
I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs
Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, a bitch might give you a buck
Man, but since you my boy you better use a condom before you try to fuck
Take the game from this show bug, 'cause Silkk ain't no love
I give 'em a little somethin', but at the end I take 'em back and get the most love
And ain't no beam 'em up Scotty, ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work
It all depends on TRU niggas like us, not no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze)
All you ghetto ho's get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig
Bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in
Approximately five minutes

You smokin' my weed ridin' my ride
I'm TRYIN' TO KEEP IT REAL

Her rent ain't paid, but she got her hair done
This bitch gotta be stopped!!!
Ho thinks she got it made, gon' ride my pockets to the top
But oh no, you Bitch, you
I ain't responsible, for what that other nigga did to you
[Don't] give a fuck what that nigga bought you
Give a fuck bout' what you and another nigga been through
Get the fuck out my face, ya' fam too, stop runnin'
Behind my G dues, can't wait to see that nigga that got
Acting like that cause that ass whoopin' been due
It's a nigga like that, that make it hard
For me and the rest of my niggas
Meeting these tramps and treat em like queens

Oh I took that extra checkbook
I need my... hair, nails, toes did

A five karat diamond ring for my birthday, and
Don't forget to pick up some pampers and milk
Also I chose pickles, and Ice Cream

Gonna be a father, oh yeah, and don't forget to

Man, I ain't talking about the Prop, I ain't talking bout the Roc
I don't talk bout mine, why will I talk on what you got
What you talking bout? Cause you ain't talking about a lot
And nigga, I'm from the ghetto so I talk about the block
They say in every rhyme that I talk about my Glock
But I squeeze for real and don't do no talking when I pop
""Punta maricon, cabron"" then you drop
And I stand on my own, I don't be talking to no cops
And I ain't talking for Chris and I ain't talking for Neef
And I ain't talking for Sparks and I ain't talking for Free
I ain't talking for Crakk, I got words for Oschi
But I ain't talking bout that, I'm talking for me
B Sig the sequel, better yet, the prequel
Never fear for war, this hog know I squeeze still
For that thing of ours till we D.I.E

I'm a grown-ass man; I don't sit on niggas' laps
And I ain't looking for no gifts outta Santa Claus' sack
Santa ain't real, let alone is he black
Catch him coming down my chimney and the Mac'll go Vrack!
(You scared) Get a dog, get a cat
I bet the cat put the tongue on you rats
Niggas extend their hands, put their hands in their lap
Scared to face the man in the mirror: Mike Jack
The mere sight of Beans raise the hairs on your back
Niggas talking ""compared to Sig you wack""
Scrap, I know you ain't wanna talk about that
But since niggas talking, let's talk about facts
From the city where it's long dark nights here
Where hard knock life's real (MJ, Annie are you OK?)
I'm so bad, I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a thriller
Holding a snub with a glove that don't glitter, nigga

This ain't a diss record, this a real record
How it feel to get exposed? Don't you feel naked?
I was the fly on the wall, the shit I witnessed
I could say shit that make B look at you different
And my gangsta wasn't never on trial
But I was, I stood up tall, no snitching
But the rapper Shawn called the police on me
Cause I was front row at the Blueprint 3
I just wanted to see him MC
And reminisce when we was the R.O.C
But he called on the C.O.P's
Not only that, he brought in the F.E.Ds (snitch)
So that's telling me ""F.U. Sig""
So F you too and F Bleek 3
See, whether I rap or riddle out this motherfucker
Pack a Gat keep a pistol out this motherfucker
Crack a brick down the middle out this motherfucker
My name good in every hood out this mother fucker

Real rap
See, I think I held my tongue long enough
About this whole Roc-A-Fella situation
I was the realest thing that happened to the Roc
The Roc was just a rock
I brought the fellas to Roc-A-Fella Records
Hot 9-7, stay proper, y'all remember
I brought the street cred to that
That thing etched in stone
I fought all them battles, me, that's who
Jadakiss, Nas, Dipset
Anybody you would've told me to go after
Matter of fact you ain't even have to tell me
I front line for that Roc
For that finger guard
For that diamonds that people was throwing up
I'd a took a bullet for Roc that day
This ain't about a dollar
This ain't about me hating on you cuz or anything
Cause I never asked you for a dollar
When I came home from jail
Home, out here in the day
When you ain't come one day to come see me
Not one picture, a letter
I went to the office and asked you
Let me off Roc-A-Fella Records, out that situation
Cause somebody, no man no blame, wanted me
And they wanted to give some real money
And you bounced that tennis ball around in your office for a hour
And went back and forth with me and told me you ain't wanna let me go
You remember that don't you?
You even asked me did I want some money and I told you I don't want your money
But you was in a position to make me get my own money
And you couldn't do that
But Sigel so real
And you will never go to jail again cause you knew I would shoot
If my life was a movie, Sigel be the sequel
You ain't fit for war
Cause Sigel's in the field
It's etched in stone
My gangsta ain't never been on trial
But guess what:
How 2Pac say? I ain't mad at ya
I understand, everybody can't go
And you are already old
Oh, and don't get it fucked up
This ain't the green light for everybody to start making ""diss Jay-Z"" records
Nah, I still got love for the nigga
This me taking my brother in the yard for 5 minutes
Cause I got a knot in my chest that need to get unloosened
And you got love for a motherfucker don't go away that easy
See, many people gonna walk in and out your life
But only real friends leave footprints on your heart, dog
But I think yours fading in the sand
And that's real rap
And if me and you don't never talk again, dog
And I gotta holla at you via MC on this mic, what up?
How you say? Scream at me

Or is my imagination tripping off some weed?
Is this all the shit I really need?

[Verse 1]
I'm on, I'm grown, I'm so in my zone
You ain't gotta tell me, I know this my home
Throw me my phone, let me call up anybody
Who don't know about it and tell 'em I am him
Pale and not so slim
But I shine bright even when it's dark and grim
She marched on in but she far from a saint
Knowin you's pretendin that you are what you ain't
Cause your startin to taint what once was pure
Irregardless I must endure
Cause what's for sure, is that I am blessed
Just give me what I'm owed and I might get rest
See slight success, only brings more hunger
But don't you mistake lightning for thunder
Cause thunder just rumbles, lightning strikes
Like men of great faith, then white's hype
[Hook]
Why your rims spin, spinnin
I ain't slept ten minutes
No shut eye 'til this is
Right, yeah, is finished
I came for that big spinach
And I can't get it, with image
So all I can do is spit vintage
Again and again and again

[Verse 2]
Just draw the play up and run it
Vision, something that's great, I've become it
I played it and won it and profited it from it
A wonderful life and with honor I've done it
But you gotta confront it, it's permanent shorty
Feel the flames is burnin you softly
Yes these lames is certaintly salty
That's how I know that the birds is off me
All I really ever wanted in my whole life
Was to stay the whole night, in the morning no flight
To have my own wife, instead of havin to borrow
Johnny's in Philly and Chad's in Toronto
I ask for a lot though, thus I accept it
I'm gonna die lonely, big money's my homey
So Betty why don't we proceed to the suite
My pet snake skeet, so eager to meet (yeah)
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm special, especially when these lames is next to me
Every check I see, bring the flex outta me
Girl I'll pay for your love, and the sex I'll free
Okay, don't play, you gon' stay, then stay
But if you afraid of livin, then you ain't really wit it
Then please be on your way, with no delay
They say only the strong survive
And it seems that you gotta do wrong to thrive
But the truth ain't dead, I'm so alive
You don't want me to shine, then close your eyes

Bitches, relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker, ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Rémy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my four on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit

Astaghfirullah, yeah!
Yeah, this one right here, ha
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there…
Ya dig?
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest—
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word ""bitch""– cursing, I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further, ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac
Nas' It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom, and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world, and listen
It dropped
[Hook 1]
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

[Verse 2]
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking ""Golly, God guard me from the ungodly""
But by my 30th watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought; what constitutes a prostitute
Is the pursuit of profit, then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said ""Don't knock it, mind your business""
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping, got it
[Hook 2]
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, their cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV 'cause it hurts me soul

[Verse 3]
So through the Grim Reaper sickle-sharpening
Macintosh marketing, oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation, Islamic martyrdom
Precise, yeah, laser-guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand-camouflaged army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama and them
They breaking in my car again
Deforestation and overlogging, and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing
Hydroponic coughing, and
All the world's ills
Sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels
Like that
[Hook 3]
They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it hurts me soul

It hurts me soul
It hurts me soul

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money

New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me on a bus?

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry, ask the dumb hottie
Masked, pump-shotty—somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties, he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimy limey, slimy— try me blimey!
Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow 'em like throwing Rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste, there's more cats to chase—
Dogs, he got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying, ""Please make me a dub""
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone...
Cowboy
[Interlude: MF DOOM]
[Applause]
No, no, no, no enough

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Goony goo-goo, loony cuckoo
Like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue, but who knew
The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a tracklist in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in it for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him ""spike the punch""
Curses, he's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy
[Interlude]
[Applause]

[Outro]
Sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying
They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent
Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come
The villains

You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me, that's who)

So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong (I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me)
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song (Woo)
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then
I know who I paid, God, Serchlite Publishing

You said you've been in this ten, I've been in it five, smarten up, Nas
Four albums in ten years, nigga? I could divide

Man listen, all this walkin' is hurtin' my feet
Ooh, money looks sweet
Where at? In the Isuzu Jeep
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints and scramblers
And gamblers, and dirty money handlers
Dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras
Slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe, Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Albemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave., Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave. to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest
High flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set, now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon and Stars, furthermore born knowledge
Go hard
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Uh, yeah, yeah, check it out, remix
Risin' up out of the flames like a phoenix
Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowin' I'm sowin' seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it, and did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it, and bleed it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay 'em out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, underappreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from somethin' that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gon' take it, face it
I keep doin' it well, doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth, doin' it again
For Illadelph and who else, but check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everythin' inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimmin' with them great whites now is how to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shinin'
Rock rolla, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping he don’t get rope for your throat to choke anything
Oh, and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs
With a switch and stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My **** is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I ***** you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller, but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now, watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like, ""Let me holler at you, mama""
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the ******' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam, but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a ******' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama
And Dalai Lama
Tell Miley I'm a knight in shinin' armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture of my genitalia
With a note sayin', ""*****, I can't wait to **** ya""

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block

They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again

Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru

In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh

Burn 'em down and you can have it back

I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me

Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan
[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, 'cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like us

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream ""¡Papí, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, 'cause we the only thing to talk about
[Chorus: M.I.A., Lil Wayne & T.I.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (And I'm gone)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Wow!)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Ya think)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (That's right!)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Aye, you can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

[Chorus: M.I.A., T.I.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, That's right)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, so you notice, huh?)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Yeah!)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Okay, tell'em for me shawty)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Yeah, that's right)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah!)

[Outro: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us

Where's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

[Verse 1]
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)
(Dial 118 please)
[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game
(Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

[Verse 2]
Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
(Flatline)
[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

[Verse 3]
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply ""What a night""
""Welcome back, Hip-Hop — I saved your life""
[Outro: Nurse]
He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good

Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get ya flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh

I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man

For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?

Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be

Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

Time to expand, New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto: Clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Pérignon
We're buying out the bar and Don Juan
And every woman's Chandonin'
Long donging 'em down like Sean Michaels does 'em
I'm like a psycho fucking, sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister
C'mon on, sister, Big Pun's Mr. ""Cock and Squeeze"" like a gun tester
Crushing sister's backs with the demon snap, hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax, let me feed the cat
Living fat, true mack, niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck, just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggas coming short with money
I called my son, he told me chill, he'd be over in twenty
Punny, what's the deal? Niggas wanna kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flipping
Locked the clip in, started lifting
Niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now but it'll take more to hold me down

Flashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat

I miss the E-Classes, rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First, you shining like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin

Now, should I slit my wrists? Go for it all or call it quits?
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedies, above the law
Fuck 'em all
I'm coming for the rich, thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course, I bury any adversary trying to floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage
Feeling the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules - the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto
I ain't judging, but bugging, how we fall so many levels?
The devil's got us by the balls
That's why the law allows the drugs to overflood
Knowing we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the Bible
Whichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal

The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?

The mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scorned, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
Yeah we like to thank all of y'all, but fuck President (Georgia) Bush

And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs

Fuck President (Georgia) Bush

Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist (Yes)
Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man
And the women say ""damn"", them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb ""Boom""
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch, log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said ""fuck it"" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving: couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got dough
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, $60,000 a verse",188,en,en,en

She used to have a man; I used to have a side-chick
Shorty got wind; I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him; they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano; me, I played with white keys
Shorty from the South—oh, I think she like me
Shorty like Pac; me, Big Poppa
She screaming, ""Hit 'em up!"" I'm screaming ""Who shot ya?""
I'm on that red wine; shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet; we both getting nice
Me, I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC: She lives in my lap

Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front

Both covered in gold like C3P0

Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to take over, I caught her bumping ""Ether""
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it

[Verse 1]
My weed smoke is my lye, a key of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high, with new clothes on I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
Ugh, a radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck
If you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is an okey-doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it

That's just the way that I talk, yo

(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo

A burglary is a jook, a wolf's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F
If you got killed, you got left
But if you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
""Hit me on the hip"" means page me
Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub, a victim's a mark
A sweatbox is a small club, your ticker's your heart
Your apartment is your pad, your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab, and heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it

[Verse 3]
The iron horse is the train, and champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine she's a dime, a suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine, if you in love that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing, bleeding is leaking
Begging is bummin', if you nuttin', you cummin'
Taking orders is sonnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L, you took a loss, to show off mean floss
Uh, I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it

By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown hot block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said ""pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process

The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'

Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine's a steady grow, perico
Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom?
Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners
Heavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks to strippin' a Lexus
Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done

Killa!
Let's get the riot on, acting like I'm lying, huh?
5 years probation, possession of a firearm (that's New York)
Did the county, bologna like it was ""Ground Round"" (that's Texas)
Zeek ran an ecstasy ring, he on the countdown (North Carolina)
Seran down the V, coke in the whip...he bought the Chaper (Chicago)
Victoria secrets? Nah it was secret indictments
Jim indicted but Kelina from P.C could fight it (uptown Rucker)
Up in the peach, yeah the weed at least he could light it (then what?)
Then Zeek shot, then E killed, then B popped, then me rocked
Yeah, but we shooting back, I'm pulling out the four fifth
If I ain't get 'em yet, believe their name is on the short list
Yeah, niggas nauseous, I'll show you just what nauseous is
We surround fortresses, studios and offices
You should be cautious, kid, 'fore the boss of this off ya lid

(Da da do) that means drop it and run it
No fronting 'cause the coppers is coming, like
(Da da do) that's when we popping them bottles
With some models on our hip is some hollows (Dipset!)
Before they shot they had to valet me
Back in New York, my P.O gonna violate me
Said ""why you acting pure as Nixon?"", she said ""you had no permission
To go to D.C...you know that's out the jurisdiction"" (I'm on business!)
""Ma, I gotta eat...I don't know your religion
I got child support, I can't endure the bitching (I can't take it)
Plus some cousins in college, add on more tuition (education)
Said she got me on tape, flipping a quarter chicken (not me!)
Nah...that Persian-white, murder-type, fur was right (about $20,000)
You heard the price, on my neck herds of ice
Vertebrae snapped, gats...huh, I swerve 'em right
Dipset, bitch, yes, peep our urban life
Like lighting herb tonight, cops come, adjourn the site
They leave...U-turn...customers, we serve 'em right

I'm proving this, you losing this, there's nothing you could do with this
I'm disturbing the peace, right? Just call me Ludacris (Luda!)

Can't pop fly, I get my socks tied

Crack open bottles of that liquor, pour it in
Gonna take a swallow of that vodka and gin
Hoes making cheese off of tricks who'll spend
Up all they money, ho you gotta check em in
Game recognize, eyes lit like a match
Blaze up this fire, paranoid like on crack
Riding with my dogs, dodging laws when we roll
Through the Dixie Homes me and Toby on a stroll
See a short skirt and we looking for a ho
One that'll suck dick, one that'll go
Coward ass niggas get wrong and we blast
Never knowing who always wear a mask
Talking that smack, then reach in the stash
Dumping them slugs then mash on the gas

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?

Where Im From,rap,JAY-Z,1997,247475,{},"[Intro]
Uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh  (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

[Verse 1]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
""Damn, I was just with him yesterday""
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 3]
Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size
It always starts out with three dice and ""shoot the five""
Niggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

When I picture bits and pieces
Of bone chip and flesh, it tears me to pieces
Cooperate, escaping's useless

This is DJ EZ Dicc

When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now, I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple mo' times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

Approach her with a different proposition

With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth

Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above

Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

[Verse 1: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix
[Verse 2: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg & Warren G]
I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel
[Interlude]

[Outro: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this

Tout a débuté un matin quand à dix heures dix
Je fus tiré du lit par l'emmerdeur de service
Mon voisin du dessus, en bon fan d'Elvis
Passe ses week-ends à foutre à fond
De lives de Memphis
Le pire, c'est que je n'ai quasiment pas dormi de la nuit
Sache qu'hier au soir, je suis sorti, mec
Jusqu'à six heures du mat
Tu peux comprendre ça?
Ça ne me fait pas plus de quatre heures de sommeil, exact!
Je vais encore passer la journée la tête dans les vapes
En plus, j'ai des rendez-vous importants, des interviews
Ça risque d'être chaud, je suis de mauvaise humeur je l'avoue
Mais j'assume. Je contrôle
D'ailleurs, je suis déjà au volant de ma caisse
Direction les Abbesses
Où j'ai rendez-vous avec
L'homme que l'on nomme Joey, Joey Starr
Mais j'ai pas fait 500 mètres que les keufs m'arrêtent
Et me prient de me mettre sur le coté afin de me soumettre
À un contrôle d'identité, simple formalité
Quand on a ses papiers
Mais voilà, là, je les avais pas sur moi
J'ai donc été invité au commissariat, où là
Ils m'ont mis la fièvre pendant, pendant des heures
[Refrain 1]
Mais ils m'ont mis la fièvre
Pendant des heures, et ils m'ont mis la fièvre pendant des heures

[Coulet 2 : JoeyStarr]
Putain, trois heures maintenant que je l'attends
Marre de faire la borne kilométrique comme trop souvent
Le revoyant, me précisant, en insistant
Qu'il me faut arriver dans les temps pour un truc important
Quand apparaît devant moi une biatch
C'est mal barré pour que je reste planté là
C'est mal barré, faut que je me décide et fasse mon choix
Temps de réaction: très net, c'est net
J'ai plus qu'une seule idée en tête : faut que je la serre!
Avant que cela ne me manque, il faut qu'on fasse la paire
Mais il faut que je tempère mon excitation
Car j'ai déjà la fièvre à la vue de ce canon
Donc sous hypnose, trop contemplatif, je n'ose
Non, non, non, laissez-moi un peu de temps, c'est pas le bon moment !
Je sais, j'ai pas la journée mais je peux prendre tout mon temps
Tant il lui plaît que je lui fasse du rentre-dedans
Cette femme qui s'ondule, moi ça j'aime, tant pis pour Kool Shen
Je la lâche pas, non, j'enchaîne, comme se le doit l'orfèvre
Jamais, jamais d'un coup deux lièvres
Alors, pendant des heures
[Refrain 2]
Mais elle m'a mis la fièvre
Pendant des heures, et elle m'a mis la fièvre pendant des heures

[Couplet 3 : Kool Shen]
Oh, mais ils m'ont mis la fièvre, pendant des heures
Je suis resté assis sur un banc, contre le radiateur
J'avais pourtant des choses à faire
J'avais beau leur répéter, mais y'avait rien à faire
C'était définitivement pas mon jour :
Déjà le rock au réveil, j'étais pas vraiment pour
Y'a des jours comme ça où tout ne va pas pour le mieux
Y'a des jours où tout part en couille, tout coule

[Couplet 4 : JoeyStarr]
Parle pour toi, neshè, car pour moi ce fut terrible
J'ai passé la journée avec une meuf terrible !
Une biatch de magazine
Beaucoup plus bonne que la plus bonne de tes copines !
Donc, je te laisse imaginer la suite
Je te fais pas de dessin, ça risque d'être censuré dans le clip
Mais bon, il n'y eut pas de répit, pas de trêve
Pendant des heures et des heures

Y'all are John McCain, you can't lift your arms up
These po-ranhas, live by a certain code of conduct
Fuck fly hoes and blow ganja
He a prophet, predict shit
The year 2029 is gon' be the apocalypse caused by the Apophis - me
I got it lock and key
Tell the labels we 'bout to go on a shoppin' spree
And if y'all don't wanna sign us, you corny
Tell your hoes swallow two of these nuts and call us in the mornin'
We the answer, to the dance floor please
You gotta fuck us all bitch, you can't Or-tease
Budden, Crooked, Nickel, damn whore please
We up in this bitch like trans or see
We the Voltron crew, it's whatever your folks wan' do
We turn this bitch into SOCOM 2
I'm the best rapper alive, Lil Wayne's migraine
Jay-Z's headache, touchin' what the lead ain't
Motherfuck your feelings, you don't know with what you're dealin'
Tryin to ""ketchup"", you mustard spillin'
I'm amongst hustlers killin'
Money stacks touch the ceiling, what a fuckin' feelin'
You will never feel, you will never sell
You can't see me, feel me, they should use my knuckles instead of Braille
I walk with the toast - feelin like
How the fuck is talk is cheap? Talk is what's gon' cost you the most
I'm the one really yo
I'm the gun spark like Omilio, you a J-Hood done video
That ain't a diss so please don't diss me
The mag' barrel longer than the G's on 50
I tell a bitch click your heels twice and ease on with me
This is the life... we gone
[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
I ain't with the leanin' and rockin'
That ain't even seen as a option, nigga as a teen I was mobbin'
Stick him up, if it's in his jeans then I'm robbin
Mayne, walk around like the thing get to cockin' (what?)
But I ain't even tryna be seen when it's poppin'
You ain't seen hoppin 'til you seen with a rocket
Pull up, lookin' real clean in the drop and (nigga)
I ain't hit the bing or a cot since
Dog, tell your whole team ya cannot win
'Til they make some type of vaccine, I'm a problem
I don't sleep on a soul, got that wrong (nigga)
Even Ben Vereen can get tapped on
Clapped on, mashed on, like M.O
My M.O. is Rambo, ammo
Got money now so there's marble on the handle
On wax so let's beef with no candles
Dismantled, click, bam!
Got some shit your man won't with-stand (nigga!)
I make the hood like V.I.P
Now you can't even get in without a wrist-band
I'm just, bland
Learn when you walk with your head too high is when shit hits the fan
Damn, Grant Hamblin, grand tamperin'
In two bars I'll send your mans scramblin'
Now how it feel to throw punches and can't land 'em?
Or be powerless while you can't stand 'em
And treat Comp like Richard Simmons
Behind closed doors the boy gon' manhandle him
Get out-paced 'til you out the race
If you worried about your face, about face (nigga!)
Cause, if you ain't all about your papes
Then nigga you a transgender, all outta place
[Verse 3 - Crooked I]
When I face off, picture a thug missin' his mug
Any particular stick in the mud could get hit with a Scud missile
'til he's, drippin' ridiculous blood
If you, rather stick to the fists and the gloves
Then you, gettin' hit on, more than the prettiest bitch in the club
Nigga I'm itchin to bug!
Itchi'n like a syphilis dick, itchin' like the skin of a bitch
Addicted to drugs, just to hit you with slugs
I did it because I wanted to!
Shoot you in back of your head right in front of you
That's what the gun'll do
All I do is son ol' niggas on the W
All I do is make all newcomers come anew
I ain't lyin', sir
You ain't gotta watch Tim Duncan jump to see a flyin Spur
Bentley boy, no it's not ""H to the Izzo""
But I push buttons like Jay shoulda did Joe
People's choice, the voice of my time
With Royce Da 5'9"", we boys and night shine
I let Joell poison my mind
Grab a silencer and kill y'all noise with my 9
As Spalding balls'll get tossed in the hoop
Pierce from Boston explains how often I shoot
I'm a Molotov crossed with a nuke
See I swallow liquor bottles 'til they hollow then I crawl in the booth
I'm the truth, polygraph Crooked
You prolly have a cardiac heart attack when I autograph bullets
Mo' caskets - put so much bread on your head
When my gunners are done, man they owe taxes
Bow-legged, knock-kneed, one irregular shoe
And you supposed to be steppin' to who?
Tell 'em All Crooked came for war
The best ever on the West unless your last name's Shakur
[Verse 4 - Joell Ortiz]
Just be easy buddy, relax
Please don't have me bloody my axe
Or revvin' my chainsaw to sever your brain off
With no concentration I'm better than Adolf
Never been laid off, forever put in work
As beats and skeets I fucked every bitch that said I was a jerk
Heh, it's like you cuter when you word maneuver
Got every dot-com in my palm and I don't know how to work computers
Yeah it's true, Slaughterhouse, I know you heard the rumors
That's new but '02 e'ry verse was ruder
Than you worthless losers
So we formed a four alien alliance, just dyin' to earth intruders
E'rybody's a president, bunch of Herbert Hoovers
If what I said had legs it could burn a cougar
Speakin' of burn, I'm hip-hop sixty shots of Henny on the rocks
You're eggnog with a squirt of Kahlua
Can't lie, it's mad fun bein' zoned
My flow is straight, yours slant like Gumby's dome
Lotta guys don't want me on
But as long as I get in a spot with my fists, my gun be home
I will beat you dudes like you stole from moms
In an audience at shows I just fold my arms
I'm so disappointed in you new rap guys
I'm like no! C'mon, how'd he do that? Why?
Oh, no, he diggity do that doe
""I'm MC so-and-so, where's my ringtone dough?""
See that ain't gon' cut it long as I'm around
That goes for every person, place or thing that describes a noun
It's J-O-E-double what I never take
Whoever feel they could give me my first one then set a date

""Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?""
""Is this not why you are here?""

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Turn the music up, turn me down
Guru, let's go get 'em again
This time it's for the money, my nigga
Brooklyn, stand up

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up

What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I gave this up to you
I know this much is true, true, true
My love

What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down south
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe till the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat
[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
Let's go!
(What more can I say?)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music, the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no, I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)

Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like ""Saturday Night Fever""
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, ugh

Tie the nigga up from his head to his feet
Then I light the nigga up from his head to his feet
Put his body in the water and his head on the beach
Light another blunt 'cause it save me the grief

I don't give a fuck, I'm straight from the streets

Lie to the bad guy, ""Hi"" to the good dope
Ride with the bad guy, try and you get smoked
Lie and you get smoked, lie for a nigga, though
Try for a nigga, though, die for a nigga, though
Why would a nigga go to New Orleans?
This is Katrinaland
The President flew over, and he ain't even land
We ain't even mad, we ain't even playing
It's duct-tape season in my region
And you ain't leaving until we eating
And I want my piece and I want my peeps to get their piece
And they want their peeps to get their piece
And until then, tell you peeps, ""No peace""

I'm Young Money, Young Mula, baby
Break in a nigga car at the light
Put the gun to his head, make him park on the right, and
Then I tell him, ""Don't talk,"" make him get out and walk
And then, I tell my goons, ""Get right in""
When you fucking with a nigga like me
No homo, but you're fucking with a rider
But they no heard me, when I tried to...

C Section,rap,Canibus,2002,1659,{},"[Chorus]
This is the C Section, ripping and wrecking
The lyrical legend sending y'all to Mic Club heaven
This is the C Section
A lyrical legend, second to none in this profession

[Verse]
I spit it exquisite and rip it minute by minute
I'm in it to win it, you fucking rhyme with Bis you finished
Lyrical menace scrape enamel off your teeth like a dentist
With a sedative administered from the executive senate
Poor progression followed by metaphorical methods
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing, testing
Supreme supremacist nemesis to competitors
Predators eat intestines of anything they interested in
Slice you like lettuce and celery start seven
Then make an MC salad out of suckers and sell it
For an expensive percentage with nine tenths of the credit
Drink Red Bull beverage to increase lyrical leverage
I only give respect to Mic Club members and my own mentors
In the center of my circle where I dare you to enter
This is art imitating life imitating art
Imitating the brain simulating thoughts when I talk
Idealistically I spit for free
The stenography of the rhyme is what balances me, challenges me
EA-6B Prowlerss, superior air power
Will fly around us with propulsion that's soundless
Spitting rhymes out by the thousands
Nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue calm me down a bit
Attitude - cynicism and lassitude
Battle you? Come on dude, I should slap you fool
Spit what, I'll leave your lips numb the friction is so sick son
Your chin'll disappear from attrition
Rhythmic high intensity conflict is a given it
Especially if Canibus is doin the rippin
You snipping to clipping in the C-section incisions
With scissors with rubber ergonomic grip for the fingers
Liars for hire with a defense like Geoffrey Fieger
And rock it like thugs who work for Mic Club
Hyped up, tear the mic up my man
And move forward as expeditiously as I can
Ain't nobody in the world like Bis
The nitrous with radio telescopic devices, same type shit
Facially hairless, a gregarious Jamaican-American
Lyricist turned microphone terrorist
Airlift me off the front line to my therapist
So I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this
This is what they want, this is what they love
To engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs
While I'm in the cut satellite tracking you rappers
With months of food rations beneath the Catacombs of Paris
Theories of super-lattice and super-savage
Atomic attack tachometers flash when I punch the gas bitch
The farther I climb the harder I rhyme
You gotta face death and survive to feel more alive
The quality of life is an illusion of the mind
Super-imposed lines look two-dimensional from the side
According to the science of the C-section applied
If they say I'm the best after I die - don't be surprised
I C section the sky let my energy rise
At the moment of truth I know it's definitely my time
As my soul is eased through the sieve I'll be grateful because I lived
The only drawback is that I didn't have kids
To C-section my beautiful wiz
And see the resemblance of my face in hers or his
Who knows what the future will bring, it stresses me to think
This mic meant everything now it doesn't seem important
Now I gotta follow orders, defend borders
From Maine to California, Seattle to Florida
If I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her
I'd speak to her about my passions
As the hourglasses turn and my life passes
I'll just wait 'til I see the Master and I'll just ask him
Forget it, that's the future, this is the present
A message to anybody listening to the C section

Low brim, no smile; lot of cash, meanwhile

Hustlers on the blocks cars were aero-dynam-y

It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Talent]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
[Chorus: Talent & 2Pac]
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!"")

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon

Drama A/T,rap,Canibus,2002,2355,{Luminati},"[Verse 1: Canibus]
Executive Order 11002
The reason you know me but I don't know you
You really wanna know what drama is let me show you
But keep in mind this is just one point of view
Drama is livin' in a 3rd world country
Fucked up and hungry without no money
Drama is trying to adjust to circumstance
Missing more than one leg or more than one hand
Drama is being chased off ya' land
By a funny looking man in a suit that works for the bank
Drama is what's happening to the ecosystem
And the animals it feeds, from the damage to trees
To rainforests that get destroyed annually
Damn is it just me who cares about the air that we breathe?
Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with
One bomb and everybody's dead that's some sick shit
Drama is HIV statistics
The infected person that you might have sex with, life goes on
But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could have prevented it
Drama is imminent, it comes in other forms
The sick pedophiles who support child porn
Never mind the offenders
Think about what the victims go through and what the fuck they gotta' live wit
Drama is the prison population
Some belong there but also some belong on probation
Drama is not being able to change one thing
Cause the system you live in says you ain't shit
Drama is corporate scandal
Drama is a handful of CEO's playin' you for a damn fool
Drama is being a millionaire
But gotta' recoup half the budget from your 10 percent share
Drama is having one too many women
Even though you always need a spare one to swim in
Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses
Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion
Drama is blind devotion
Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open
Drama is having your heart broken
And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice
Drama is trying to carry a burden all by yourself on your shoulders and it don't exist
Drama is being falsely accused, Drama is the latest news
Drama is what gives people clues
Drama is a tool you can use to distract ya' enemy so they never improve
Drama is the fear of devils and the fear of God
Drama is a long and hard Tech support desk job
Drama is the life of an up-and-coming actor or rapper
Or athlete or building contractor
Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup
The 3 strike perpetrator that's getting tatted up
Drama is the spin zone of a politician
Drama is K-Solo when he said the rhyme did it
Drama is the struggle of change
Drama is inevitable there is no other way
Drama is what drains life force out of you
Drama is negative but drama can empower you
Drama is love, Drama is pain
Drama exists in everything everyday
Drama is the Yin, Drama is the Yang
Drama is the innate nature of man
Drama contracts, Drama expands
Drama is what I am
[Interlude: Canibus]
Drama! Drama!

[Verse 2: Luminati]
Pull up a chair to the aristocracy of commonwealth prophecy
The legacy of generation three isosceles
Logical geometry, illogical melodies
Integrated with memories that mix melodically
Beyond the insight of what a modern-day monkey sees
Get chopped in three for pathetic hypocrisy
False bureaucracy breeds poetic monopolies
Chateau de Trevano is my property
An addict for drama and dramatic oddities
Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany
In a reflection of the split seas you see me in 3D
Tripping off three hits of E
Half-a-tablet for you 2-and-a-half for me
A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity
Naturally ignore gravity project astrally
Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me
Earth's actually esoterically absent to me
Take a crack at me with blurred clarity - battle me
Spiders crawl outta the skin the six headed beast
Evil beings that wrestle with demons in the deep
Useless to eat 200 pounds of rotten meat
Shrink heads drink black milk collect black teeth
Luminati tribal chief wear it as trophy piece
My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath
Like Christmas minus Christ plus the heat
The Ascended Master, leader of all immortal freaks
Voodoo curse on your last and future release
Unleash the worst plague put the world under siege
Till your name is unheard and your face is unseen
Till your just a nightmare of an accursed dream
Tell the supreme to curse your whole team and your unborn seed
Poison your queen like the Furher's last week
In the blood filled streets you're a leech
Less than a man a poverty stricken thief with grief
At night you speak to Satan before you go to sleep
Worshiping the flesh like poor pagan priests
Your future's oblique
I command your heart to seize its beat
Thou shall inherit disease and defeat! Drama!

Double-R tee with the matching bandana
.38-snub, blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryna glance at the 'Kiss
'Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Boning your women, drunk off Coronas and lemon
And you know I'm still writing the mean, lighting the green
I need the buggy, even though I look right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
'Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
Call me raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me, you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay thirty for the 'Kiss (Uh-huh), a hundred for The LOX (Yeah)

Nope, it was all good
The stocking was hung on my big fat dick
We was hoping to get some of that good shit
From old jolly Saint Nick
The children were snuggled up, sleeping in bed
My bitch on my jock, giving holiday head
When outside my crib there rolled such a clatter
I stuck my head out and yelled ""What tha fuck is the matter?!""
Then a fat, red pimp got out of his ride
It was perfectly clear he was from the North Side
""Yo Santa what's up? Did you bring me some chronic?""
And Tanqueray gin I can mix with my tonic?
He said ""ho, ho, ho"" and opened his sack
It was stuffed full of indo, had to take a step back
""Is this for the Dogg? Did you bring this for me?
To blaze with my hoes and my closest homies?""
He just nodded his head, his eyes about shut
It was then that I knew that Saint Nick was fucked up
He ate all my motherfuckin' cookies
I left on the plate
Then he went to the fridge
And he ate, and he ate, and that fat motherfucka ate
And when he was done
When the cupboard was bare
He packed his shit up and got outta there
""Good night Doggy Dogg!"" he said from the sky
""Merry Christmas to all you motherfuckers
And to all a good high""

For the car cop the cell in the bar stop at hell
""What's wrong with you?"" She said, ""what's wrong with you?""
Always got a song to do can't get along it's true
So I skipped marriage, bought her six karats
Rather die that nigga than to live average, Killa (Killa)
[Chorus: Smokey Robinson sample]
If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, uhh...
Looking back on school: art and crafts
Fucked half the staff, beat up half the class
I was like Dr. Dre, though, I have to laugh
Nigga with a attitude, meet me after math
Had a ""half and half""
Not a drink -- two chicks that flip acid fast
The half a tab
You could ask her ass, I would dash and laugh
You after me, huh? I'm after cash
I'm on I-80 though with my baby
Whole ride hazy tell her don't drive crazy
I got plans for you look in the sky baby
Fuck Sara Lee, Mrs. Smith; you the pie lady
Fly lady, G2 fly baby, gee you why baby
Please boo, what's your size crazy
Don Juaning when I'm in a foreign
Almond drop top, my charm is alarming
I was alerting her just to reinsert in her
That I will leave earth with her
Huh, I can't interpret her
She got mad I leaned over, I'm nursing her
Said when I do dirt with her
The only time I flirt with her
Not to be V.I but this is B.I (B.I)
Me and G.I be watched by the P.I's
See why we can't finish together
I'd rather do business than pleasure
And that's real (Killa)
[Chorus: Smokey Robinson sample]
If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?

Who put the monkey wrench in well-oiled perfectionist emblem
Just to watch these monitors spit white noise through your office space
Automater, I infect jolly gene pool descendant clown-clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starving art revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent friend from brick habitat
Bob, weave, stick, move, fence
And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crops spread spectacular, I ain't mad at ya
Don't stay mad at the caliber (I twist characters like Twist characters)
Tally up the alley cat aggression in this Doug E. Fresh infested
Mess of bass line lust and automatic b-boy Krylon can combust circuit
Working these war pig cyphers with Ted Striker stability
And kamikaze chivalry
I alone noble in a worm food feud
Walking dead generation
Ain't nobody asking for your patience
The grand opening holding me to face the fact
I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else

Fantastic planet urchin putting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion
Apologies won't lure me to the communal sob story
Nor will I sacrifice live style to benefit jury temperament
This old Green Goblin web cutter butts up against
Crayola daydream landscape spitting bedlam. Dead 'em
Charge the villagers nickels and nicotine to watch him fed to
One disgruntled kraken at high noon
We'll sell popcorn beer and balloons
I got an inkling this gon' be the one the children bicker over
It's that Warriors vs. Baseball Fury element
To glitch his motor sensory development
I am a star, really
That Big Bang bastard's back with a one-way ticket to beat street
This all is like, relevant to human kind supply/demand ratios, man, learn it

I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like niggas move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rule Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?
[Break: Puff Daddy]
We forgive you, for you know not what you do

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
7 A.M. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open the last seal for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!
[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
For the pump now Leatherface, sin runnin' thuggin' and cuttin'
Little Mo Hart want to pull it ain't nothin'
Bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guns that’s fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets

Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, ""What's happenin'?""
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run

Dumb Out,rap,Joe Budden,2005,20387,{},"[Verse 1]
Stuck between platinum and flop, underground and mainstream
Conscious, backpack, scratch that, same thing
I'm somewhere between the real and the fakeness
The red pill, blue pill -- real and the Matrix
And I can't take this;  if the game needs a new look
I'm between a tummy tuck and a face lift
And everything I say in these pages
Is straight from the heart -- nah magazines, y'all can't rate this
Cuz I'll read the bit it's a bit outragous
Like it's an ear virus and this shit's contagious
I'm downloading like, ""niggas actually play this?""
Maybe I'm bugging out, maybe I'm on a spaceship
See I was on my stay out jail shit
The way Mouse kills shit, I'm here just to lay out real shit
Besides, other dudes styles remind me of spinning rims
That shit got played out real quick
See some wrote him off, some said he was done
Made a joke of, hope he enjoyed the run
I don't enjoy being shunned, so I'm back as Neo
Fans enjoyed The One, annoint me has begun
I had the whole hood thinking he would never eat
Rappers tried to diss, thinking we would never meet
I heard it if you said it
You wrote it on online then I read it, now I match it, nigga -- bet it
Cause I remember clearly
Once ""Pump It Up"" stop soaring, there's a few motherfuckers stopped calling
See I remember shit spread like cancer
I would call folks, said folk ain't answer
A few chicks running started pulling they pants up
A few stopped acting like my private dancer
But a light bulb hit once they started to neglect me
See there I was, thinking I was all that sexy but I
Nah fuck that
Cause I'm still sexy, young and fly
Know-what-I-mean, ya heard?
[Verse 2]
Look here can't be finished, what nigga I beg ya pard'
I just let niggas get a head start
I walk to the finish, y'all spread out chase
Nah sprint out pace, and I'll still win the race (yep)
See I'm jogging
Other niggas legs starts wobbling, when opportunities start knockin
You got the crown, pass off like Stockton
It's time to work, I'm offically clocked in
He is a problem, weavin' and bobbin'
Through the speculation that his label tried to drop him
I can't leave, even though it's big options
Kev only signed me, to keep this shit rockin'
Don't ask me how I'm doin, I been better
Stuck in cold February, with a thin sweater
I'm far from a ""Yes"" man, I'm a trend setter
It's no games, just a Def Jam Vendetta
Don't put niggas in the same sink as me
I mean metaphors, story lines, deep shit, club shit, girl shit, world shit
They don't use the ink like me
Niggas don't even think like me
Who sees what I'm watching, he ain't poppin'
Don't deserve to drink water from the tub that I washed in
Wait, start again, it's a privilege to breathe the same air that I farted in
They want no parts with him
How dare niggas categorize me
If my name's on a mixtape, then capitalize me
I been stopped going to Mixtape Awards
Don't need them to tell me, the mixtapes is yours
I had other ideas, while hitting loot
I'm thinking red carpet, I went and copped a suit
See I'm thinking Grammys
Sunglasses on, with my On Top family and a bad bitch handy
He stayed at the ""W"" and felt like heaven
I'm at an actress's house, that felt like necking
R&B on, looked and felt like Meagan
Gave me headache till I felt like an Excedrin
Talk very fly
Least until I bought every pie, me me being war ready to my eyes
And these dudes might as well be Jamie Foxx
Trying to sound like somebody that already died
The kid keep a snub wit 'em, good pair of gloves wit 'em
Your first week ain't right, they can't fuck wit 'em
Now if you don't sell 5 mill, they had enough of 'em
Let me find out Hip Hop's turning Republican
I'll sum it up to what he is about
Still new to most, they still feeling him out
Things were type bland, Joey seasoned 'em out
I'm the nicest dude out since ""Reasonable Doubt""
Say it ain't so
Rest in Peace Luther, there's some other niggas gay on the low (oh)
So live, who can see 'em? No guy
I'm the Mets, was supposed to be ill in '05
As ill as the flow gets, need a pill or don't snitch
So if you can't tell, I'm preparing for '06
About to OD, anybody that know me
Can tell you I'm bout to make shit feel like it's '03
More like '99
No names should be mentioned but mine
Unless you talking Big Pun in his prime
Maybe '96 Jay, before Dame was throwing money around
Or 2pac without Humpty around
Or 50 before Em, Nas talking like a gun in his song
Cam'ron during Children Of The Corn
Beans before the cops came through and try to grill 'em
I'm talking '95, Big L before they killed 'em
Em before 8 Mile, Shyne before the jail shit
Canibus, no album out before the L shit
Talking bout Kiss, DMX when he was fuckin' wit coke
Or ""Cuban Linx,"" Raekwon and Ghost
I do it all, who blending so well in the game
Talking Fab, back when he was still spelling his name (mang)
On my Diddy shit, Memphis Grizzly shit
Like back in the day when Clue swiped all of Biggie's shit
Rappers don't need trouble with I
Unless it's Ras Kass before the D.W.I
Or Talib with Mos, Common before ""Be""
If they any less common, don't put 'em before me
See, I'm not a rapper, I'm a prophet
Chill Joe stop it, skill will speak for you, don't pop shit
Fuck jail, I'm on my payroll cop shit
I call that bootleg cable, it's no box shit
All black, looking grimey in the crowd
Heat on him, no sir, don't try me when I'm out
I tote something tiny that'll blauh
Ain't gotta see Paul Wall, if you want something shiny in your mouth
I probably fool cats, cause I don't ride out in some big car
In the streets, like I ain't some big star
And these young mother fuckers is about to fuck up
Like leaving they whole career in some bitch car
No name, but it's no sublime
Nigga, you know who you are, I'll end it before it goes too far
Your buzz still fucked, you a liar money
I'm still spending ""Pump It Up"", ""Fire"" money
Glock for hire money, don't try to mug me
Call ASCAP, maybe BMI for money
Please, what's wrong wit 'em, something ain't the norm wit 'em
Ain't too many dudes out there, out-performin' 'em
Some acquire these skills, I was born wit 'em
Street's asking what's taking so long wit 'em
Jump Off, I'm the best to happen
He's the answer, the who's got the next in rapping
I suggest you ask 'em
If Hip Hop is all smoke and mirrors, then I'm the Windex and a napkin
New dudes is whack, some vets is has-beens
Some were Top 20, till I crept right past 'em
It's a wrap, Joey sealing it nigga
Cold out, long johns, still dealing it nigga
Still peeling it, nigga
If I only get 'em two times, just know it was the Derringer, nigga
It's that 'gnac music, don't know how to act music
Gettin' my Kanye on, putting out ""Crack Music""
Car jack music, got what they lack music
Send my little man, get rid of the pack music
That I'm back music, that click clack music
That A-Team, Muggs, that Fab and Stack music
Now who said they fucking with me
They just said that fucking with me, they didn't mean it",222,en,en,en

Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

Do you wanna ride or die?

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

Do you wanna ride or die?

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail

By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters

Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles",224,en,en,en

[Intro]
Fuck Jay-Z
What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog (You? What?)
Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Fuck Jay-Z

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it
[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly (Haha)
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Interlude]
Ayo, pass me the weed (Tsk, there you go)
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man (Ain't no doubt)
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the motherfuckin' ring

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?
[Interlude]
I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss",225,en,en,en
Keep Your Shit the Hardest,rap,DMX,1998,8212,{},"[Chorus]
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down

War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it

'Cause our niggas is wit it

[Verse 1]
I want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there
'Cause doin' dirt, a nigga got to take the back way there
What it is, is the biz and it's dirty
You'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty
Place of business is the hallways, I've been up for four days
On parole with warrants that'll send me back to Rahway
If I get caught across Jersey state lines
Figure this 9-8 and I been runnin' since 8-9
So that's like 9 years delinquent time, you speak in crime then you know
9 years you owe, get knocked, 9 years you gonna go
No probation or parole more time doin' nothin'
Day room to the yard, writin' rhymes and frontin
Carry niggas greasy because I'm built like that
Bury niggas easy 'cause they get killed like that
If you ain't in it wit me then you in my way, but either or
You will respect mine and leave the TEC-9 and leave it for dude
The realest you gonna feel is when you face your death
""Sorry, I didn't know""? Nigga, don't even waste your breath
Coppin' pleas not D why you flippin'
Nigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin'
Lettin' a nigga catch you when I got my guard down, so I keep 'em up
Noddin' off with one eye open, I can freak it
But there's gonna be a time when I close 'em both
Lead poisonin', I'm a get hit with an overdose
Over those drug things, crud things
Think I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze
Raw gun playin' drama, sadness to another nigga's momma
I'mma be the the one that puts you up in shock trauma
These are troublesome times and the crimes prevail
And the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail
Bada-boom, bada-bing, some of this and some of that
I gots to boogie for a minute but you know I'm comin' back
[Chorus]
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it

Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it

[Verse 2]
Try to show niggas but I can only hope they see
You's a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3
Layin' up like this, lips sewn shut eyes closed
Niggas walk past the casket, damn shorty nice pose
You was ballin' nigga 'til your ass got balled out, called out
By some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out
I bet you thought it was real funny, until it had to get cruddy
Me walkin' off leavin' you with all this bloody
What he gonna do when it's all over for real
And the last thing you seein' is that steel?
A blast of light, that's what he seein' if you blast him right
Hit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight
'Cause it's like it ain't nothin' but endin' it to a nigga
Street sweeper like ahhhh, sendin it to a nigga
When you in the house you'll play by house rules
Two words you'll never hear again are house lose
And that's house choose it ain't gonna be that, 'cause I can't see that
Ready to get up in this nigga's ass real good, so where the weed at?
Believe that, you ain't gon' see nothin' gettin' too familiar
And I would tell you what I do but then I'd have to kill you
And it ain't even worth it, I ain't gon' build nothin'
So I just let you go be that same nigga, still frontin'
Laughin' and shit, like you see somethin' funny
What you sayin' sounds good, but let me see somethin' money
For real
(dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga nigga)
[Chorus]
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?

(Equipto)
Maybe you can catch my next show
Whether its East or West coast
I show love all through the bay
Frisco, the O, San Jose
In LA, we off to the Beverly
Hennessy on ice, at the Embassy, Suites
San Lu', Santa Barbara, all in, San Diego with the Chargers
We goin farther, touchin down
Homies run rappin, rush around
We hit Denmark, Copenhagen
Couldn't wait to get back to the golden gate
To, Santa Cruz to rock at the Catalyst
To Princeland, off in Minneapolis
All through Oregon, parking lot pimpin'
Left Portland like Scottie Pippen

(San Quinn)
Said I slide out of Frisco to Kansas City
Missouri and Kansas the girls is scandalous
Shit is hot in Little Rock, Arkansas
I said the all get in, and the shit they talk
Then its down to Texas, Houston and Dallas
Where my blunts they roll the fattest
Hate the Cowboys, despise the Rockets
Like the country girls, cats smokin dope out they pockets
Hit New York like a Giant, the swings are back
No trust, no sleep, gotta bring my gat
Lookin for the king of rap, so I can take the crown
Then I slide to the next town
(Equipto)
It was hot on the beach in Florida
On the streets got a peach in Georgia
Across to Boston,  then hit the Big Apple
Shop Bellvue, was Sleepless in Seattle
In Vegas cracked and got lucky
Two Backwoods with my boy from Kentucky
Plane soarin, this New Orleans
5 in the morning, time for performin
Montana, bay grammar, Alabama
First rap show in Havana
Nothin but bammer, stamp the passport
At the Colonial, folks in Sacto
Tokyo, back to Japan
Got to be as worldwide as I can
I'm jet laggin, money in the bag
International with my rappin

(San Quinn)
Lookin for more dough, someone come try me
At the Pro Bowl, I'm out in Hawaii
(?) girls, I'm up on them girls
Tryin to put thangs in, take thong off girls
I can get a show with Louis in Idaho
Puff some real dro' before I go back to Spokane
And catch my plane to Chicago
They searchin, dogs sniffin through my cargo
Never move illegally, from there to Tennessee
Rollin up a Titan, sippin on some hennessey
It goes down, mo' brown in Cleveland
Ass round titties big gimme head this evenin

From Yamagata to Yokohama
Suckas sound like Mary sayin no more drama
Indoja aroma its California
With females frontin off in Arizona
Its me and Quincy, off in Cincy
On a red eye flight and we high and tipsy
Mississippi and Carolina
From New Zealand all up through China
We land in London, its all on a fluke for real
And we chill in Brazil like Snoop
Proceed with caution, back to back shows in Austin
A wild response in Wisconsin
In Colorado where the groupies sweat us
Or the land down under with Gucci sweaters
In Delaware, I couldn't really care
I'ma set up my shop, from here to there

Mixing Up the Medicine,rap,Juelz Santana,2009,8180,{Yelawolf},"[Intro: Yelawolf]

My potion, now it's potent, time to hit em in the head again
Knock knock, pow pow, it's Santana let him in
I got what you need, tell a friend to tell a friend
If a label need a hit, if a fiend need a fix
Or if a chick just need some good dick, I got the (medicine)
You boys shipping whack drops
Y'all should be mascots
Come and see the splash doc
I'll give you a swag shot
Fuck what you hearin, you should listen
This is rap penicillin
Still in the kitchen (mixing, mixing medicine)
Young splash and I'm back in the building
Swagger on a hundred, thousand, trillion

And thats only half of how I'm feeling

You going home, take me with ya
I'll look at your baby pictures
But I won't have no baby with ya
Back up or ya heard me
Back up or ya head me
I'm ballin like the 80s, so James Worthy
Still makin money off the white girl, Fergie
I ain't a new boy so they know they can't jerk me
No limit how I get it, call me Percy
Miller, I'm a killer, no mercy
And I'm so dope you'd think Frank Lucas served me
So hot fire couldn't burn me
Bitches wanna nurse me
Take her out and trick around
I take her home and dick her down
Send her back to you like
""Baby I was at my sisters house""
Y'all nigga remember me
I'm every rappers enemy
Cuz they know once I get the lead
You'll never get ahead of me

Swagger on rooftops
And One's, new Glock
You wanna get loud you'll get blasted—boombox
Attitude like 2Pac when Juice dropped
Still go to the dealer with the money in a shoe box
This wasn't supposed to come out
This wasn't supposed to come out
They let that new drug out
They let that new drug out
My niggas 'bout to dumb out
My ladies 'bout to bug out
And if her body crazy, I'm a take her to the nut house
You lames ain't interesting
The games been missing this
Nigga's full of sugar and I came with the insulin
Whatever's your addiction
I got your prescription
I get it how I live it
And I'm loving every minute
You got that shit that just came out: that new new
I got that shit that ain't came out: it's too new

All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that, mommy?
*Beep*
Hi, daddy, how you doing? This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mm
You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*Beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit
You fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""
*Beep*
Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that
*Beep*
Yeah, motherfucker, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?
[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back
[Chorus: Total & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die
[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Eat your words but don't go hungry

Four-letter words I cannot say

Words of wisdom, words of strife
Words that write the book I like
Words won't find no right solution
To the planet earth's pollution
Say the right word, make a million
Words are like a certain person
Who can't say what they mean
Don't mean what they say
With a rap, rap here and a rap, rap there
Here a rap, there a rap
Everywhere a rap, rap
Rap it up for the common good
Let us enlist the neighborhood

Fuck tha Police,rap,N.W.A,1988,2360514,{},"[Produced by Dr. Dre & DJ Yella]

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
Fuck the police

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (I want justice!)
Get him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now Shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Sup Baby Girl (Ohhh)
Thought I had to talk to you again
Been a long time, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you
Rashad is missing you, your Mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no)
Your Pop is missing you, Dame is missing you
Damn, we missing you ...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
All we listen to is all the different yous
Four page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody who used to get the party poppin'
We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the Roc
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates? (I miss you)
Well, Dame told me tell you, he's doin' well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you looking over us
Our little angel, but you know what
[Hook: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you
Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you
Damn, we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview
Now he's dissin' me, 'cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude
'Cause of your memory, I won't bring it to pistols
But he got issues, enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents' pain
But I know God's protecting you
You used to read Seat of the Soul, I know God perfecting you
All the extra hue, the darker texture you are, the more intellectual
You are so professional, our little purple star
Too good for earth you are (I miss you)

Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you
D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you

Kidada's missing you, Shock is missing you
Carline is missing you, Tiny's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
By the way, Big, we missing you, Pac, we missing you
We feel your presence just not in the physical
All across the world, blocks is miserable
Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous
But they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
I swear, in hip-hop, if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more; y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man, and try to follow y'all down memory lane, man
Big, you'd be ashamed to see New York gang bang
Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain
But I guess that's the issue
And it proves how much niggas really miss you

Pun we missing you, Big L we missing you
Left Eye we missing you, Jay we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on
The world is missing you, the hood is missing you

Know what I mean? Miss y'all (I miss you)
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldiettes, all across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all living in our memories forever
We never gon' let y'all go

I can't be no more (We not remembering your death, though)
Since you went away I don't really feel like talking (We celebrating your life, know what I mean?)

I can't do a thing without you (Yes)

Hello Brooklyn 2.0,rap,JAY-Z,2007,85747,"{""Lil Wayne""}","[Intro: Beastie Boys sample]
Hello!
Brooklyn!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
Hello, Brooklyn (Uh-huh), how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too? (Uh-huh)
And If I can (Woo!), I'ma be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars (Cars), and drive me crazy (So crazy)
Wherever you going (Where you going?), baby girl, just take me (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken (I'm so taken)
I'm just saying (Woo!), baby, I'm just saying

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Like a mama, you birth me; Brooklyn, you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello, Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing?
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you going, baby girl, just take me
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hello, Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'
She said she got a man but he ain't worried
But baby, I'ma have to rob him like Horry
She said she love B.I.G., and she like 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z, she say, ""It's the Roc!""
And I'ma leave it like this—like this, like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something, you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so, I said, ""Goodbye, Katrina""

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
And ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-baby, you are
The sweetest sight eyes could see
I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-baby
I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)
So damn fine to me
And I remember the time (Time), place (Place)
And the weather (And, woo!)
On the day you said, ""Hi,"" to me
And I say, ""Hello, Brooklyn!""
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Brooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—
All demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed
Always scheming—""You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?""
(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Baby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy, though I'll lie flat in your bush
'Til we smoke a C.I., ""What up"" to the boy, B.I.?
You know I handle B-I, I don't half-step on the 'caine
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?
She like it hardcore, so I grind slow
Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0
My fine ho, we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars (Errr!), and drive me crazy (Errr!)
Wherever you goin' baby girl, just take me
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying (Yeah)
[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
And hello, Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby, you are
The sweetest thing eyes could see
Hello, Brooklyn
Baby, I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn,"" buh-baby you are
So damn fine to me
But I remember the time, place, and the weather
On the day she said hi to me
And I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn""",236,en,en,en
It Was a Good Day,rap,Ice Cube,1992,1463692,{},"[Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Intro]
Break 'em
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!

Through the Wire,rap,Kanye West,2003,1228114,{},"[Produced by Kanye West]

[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

The Nigga Ya Love to Hate,rap,Ice Cube,1990,120529,{},"[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga you love to hate

Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen, we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
""Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate""

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: ""did I like Arsenio?""
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each

Burberry's cool, Coogi sweater (Sweater)
Twenty inches, pop my feather
The Birdman daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly
Number one, don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The g-uh-g-uh-Gucci with the matchin' interior
Three-wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint, daddy, it's our summer
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, (Ho-ho-hood rich) I stay shive
Can't pay my rent 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich, la-da-di-da da-da-da-da

[Verse 2: Mannie Fresh]
Have you ever seen crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp, (Ho-ho-hood rich) I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm still fly (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich, la-da-di-da da-da-da-da

[Verse 3: Birdman, Mannie Fresh]
Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma name

Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, 'cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop & Glo
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one

The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set

Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen

Not Tonight,rap,Lil' Kim,1996,96657,"{""Lil\\' Kim""}","[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass

The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

[Intro]
Stadium status

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me

Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)

‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‘cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man

In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!

You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you 'cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp

Double clip in your mug then have SP hit it with mace

We your favorite gangstas' favorite gangstas, and duke better bolt
Before these slugs sink in his waves like anchors
We don't own clean guns, all our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas jet like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet, for the dope, I'll attach it
Make sure the joint aim point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew got Glocks on 'em
In a hurry to shoot like they put shot clocks on 'em
All that gossip you blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that get you to a hospital fast
They let Cain out the cages and shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you, I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together, and us back and forth
It's like putting Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they wanna bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi like Eddie in ""Coming to America""
Silencers, it sound like it's humming when I'm airing ya
Won't know you hit 'til your body numbing in that area
The kids don't want to see the toast to mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roastin' trauma fatties in a toasted almond Caddy
And we come through with chains glisten and thangs spitting
Hollow shots'll leave your brain missing
Ghetto F-A-B and Paul Cain nigga
We gettin heaps of complaints for keepin' it gangsta

Hey yo, we represent them down ass niggas (Okay)
M.O.P. (Okay) rip rounds at you clown ass niggas (All day)
BK nigga, get up off snooze
Don't make me put your gangsta on the six o'clock news
You ride in a what (What's up?) don't get it fucked up
Or twisted cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up
And die in that truck (Be cautious when you're walking through)
(Be careful who you talking to, come straight home)
It's the livest motherfuckers of the century
You niggas is killing me, you got to be kidding me (Aha, aha)
Ain't nobody taking it and making it, extra like dust
Showing they ass on the record and bless it like Gus
Now about them weak flows, keep those, we eat those
As far as heat goes, we keep those, the street knows
The M.O. (M.O.) P. is what's up
We in the cut, Brownsville is heating it up, come on!

[Verse 4: Lil' Fame]
Fuck your ego, I still spit lines at your bitch
Play Cee-Lo and spit .45s at your six
You don't really wanna lose your life
So I'ma smack flames out ya, pick ya money up and roof ya dice
Yo, you dun' know were we from soldier, come soldier
Dump soldier, you'll be found in your whip slumped over
With your gangsta ass, dead and you gone
Iced out, chain out with ya brains out, head on your horn
You (You) know (Know) who (Who) be keepin' it gangsta
With a truck full of goons that fakesta
And the Brownsville niggas from the past
That run up, put a hammer to ya gut, and tell ya drop it in the bag

Your day's up, children, I hope you didn't quit your day jobs
Been in it, hosting shit like Canadian Asians host SARS
I'm kidding, no really pa, you're fibbing, you rented your car
I'm spilling these phrases like seizure waitresses holding trays
This is greatness, the most endangered species on the playlist
Hey pay this, you fucks
No need to pay for a facelift you sluts
You slept, stupid I'm more dangerous than Michael's face is
I cut through it like a machete's built on my tongue
Leave you stitched up like Eeyore with your teeth all gums, you weak whore
The meek inherits now, but I speak veteran prose
Like I'm Tom Cruise in a wheelchair with my pants all sewn
Now how many times do I need to explain
You faggot Hannibal Lector niggas, you all eat brain
I will damage your whole system, hack into your mainframe
Crack your bones like I'm cracking computer codes, I am not playing
I am not done spraying nigga, give me my mic back
Don't ever, ever, ever try some shit even like that
I'm a con artist, a schemer, a dealer, a dope
That you feed to your ears through the speakers and feel it 'til it's leaking out your throat
Teacher, preacher, city-wide spelling champ
Your girl felt it so much, she started doing a belly dance
I'm heavy man, like an ACME safe in a cartoon
I'll drop-catch you man, I'll slam right into your car roof
I'm nasty, the antithesis of this mastery
Keep feeding you and feeding you with buckets of candy
Hand ransom notes to all cops at random
With the planted remote in the throat of the kidnapped grandson
For how many grams, one
Wait 'til they're in range, then pull the little chain
Clothesline them just in time to see the boy's exploding brains
I'm sick, I need help, I climb inside of a track
I tell them, I know what I'm doing those aren't snares, those are slaps
One slap, two slaps, three slaps, four
Then I spaz out and stab - forget what the fuck I was counting for
Don't fuck with me, please I'm asking nicely, back off
Put thumbtacks in my hands and grab your nuts, nigga cough
You don't understand Jean, never in your life seen
A girl with more flow than an Iraqi soldier's canteens
More ignored than a homeless on a train begging for change
More credit due to me than a store that doesn't exchange
In Cali, rip ya mayne, New York, damage ya dog
Get on a plane, la voy aca el encima in Spain
I'm dead wrong, too smart to be beefing with little tarts
Jean turn your scream into murmurs like an irregular heartbeat
Hardly the amateur, can't wait for the album tour
Fall come, I'm bringing the malice straight to your campus floor
Manhandle y'all, in France I'm Jean Van-Damnit
All writing hard like carving the Twelfth Commandment, naw
I didn't skip one cause Biggie penned the eleventh
A moment of silence for all the fallen soldiers in heaven
Now moving along children
I screw with your whole vision like fog in the road, listen
Too hot and you know it, burn like a cock when you go piss
And there's snot in the hole dripping and you gotta go to the clinic
Hey, I'm just guessing
Jean's here to level the playing field
I don't care about your spot or what you got for your record deal
I don't care about your feelings or your marketing gimmicks
I just rap -- been here, you just wasn't ready to hear it
I dropped Attack, critics hollered back with a thumbs-up
Exposing those who didn't -- Oliver Wang, you dumb fuck
Untuck your spine, gun-butt you with a Super Soaker
Make you scream louder than the sound of the background vocals
Choke you with a magazine page, then in a rage
Flip you over like quarters on the back of your arm on Happy Days
I've written about life, I spitted about art
I represent the underground cause they've been with me from the start
No, Jean's not hard now, Jean hasn't changed
I was 18 on the first record, I've just experienced the game
Not a thug, not a drug seller, not a gun shooter
Not a stripper, sex symbol, or anything you're used to
Marketing nightmare, I don't fit into categories
I just rap, make beats and shit and sleep all these stories
All I want is a voice, all the people need is choice
If there's no competition then what is the fucking point
You can't win by default, unless you're scared of a challenge

A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her

[Verse 2]
Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop

And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

[Verse 3]
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop
[Chorus]
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop

Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer lovin' yourself, kid
We livin' in them days of the man-made craze
Where every aspect is vivid
These brothers no longer talk shit, aiyo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone
Plug One translatin' the zone
No offense to a player but, yo, I don't play
Nigga, take offense? Fuck it, gotta be that way

[Verse 5: Trugoy the Dove]
I say G's are makin' figures at a high regard
And niggas dyin' for it nowadays ain't odd
Investin' in fantasies and not God
Welcome to reality, see, times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showin' out in videos, sayin' they co-starred
See, shit like that'll make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it 'cause the stakes is high

Man, them stakes is high

[Verse 6: Trugoy the Dove + Posdnous]
I think that smilin' in public is against the law (What?!)
'Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know, and ""How you, son?""
And how you gettin' in, and who the man holdin' heat, yo
And how was the skins and how high
Yo, what up, huh? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti
But they ain't organized!
Mixin' crimes with life enzymes
Takin' the big scalp route and niggas, no doubt
Better than they know their daughters and their sons
(Oh, boy)
[Verse 7: Posdnous]
Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain
Positive contact just like my main man
Who got others cleanin' up his physical and fluids
His mind got congested, he got the nine and blew it
Neighborhoods are now hoods 'cause nobody's neighbors
Just animals survivin' with that animal behavior
Under I who be rhymin' from dark to light sky
Experiments where needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high
You damn sure try to do anythin' to get the piece of the pie
Electrify, even die for the cash
But at last, you be out even though you wantin' more
This issue is closed like an elevator door
But soon re-opened once we get to the next floor where the...

Who am I? Scar mother fucking face
Who am I? A to the mother fucking K
Who am I? Belo mother fucking Zero
Who am I? Niggas Ain't Ready to Die

(Scarface)
Who the fuck am I?
A born killer with no conscience
Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience
No second chances
Cos in this game no one advances
You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances
No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks
To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot
With a 357 slug pointed at your nose
Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes
You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior
Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer
Putting niggas off in body bags cos in this game you take no prisoners
Leave it in blood Hare Krishna
Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even
You die this evening insanity gon be my reason
I trail niggas fill niggas and kill niggas
I introduce the ways that are wicked to real niggas
(Chorus x 2)

(AK)
Who ever epitomise
And idolise my murderous skills
With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill
Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks
It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked
Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour
Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour
Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge
I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard
It's too cold to proceed without a block to start
Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart
Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask
Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know
It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go
And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why
My adrenaline rush on jump
Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump

I hear some niggas talking loud like we been stealing this shit
Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick
It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut
Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up
I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest
More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest
I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll
Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own
I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style
Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile
Walk on down and see the light cos I'm not faking the shit
I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit
Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard
I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd
Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up
Separate your head from the spam and leave your bitch ass stuck

Retaliation is a must
I see niggas from behind so I bust
My Desert Eagles gon to catch you when they duck
Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck
And leave they brains fucked up
I don't know why they put they eyes on me
Cos I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key
Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me
But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be
They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat
They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets
With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it
It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat
In the dark zone it's on
And hell yeah I used to push packs
Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs
Matter of fact this shit I rap about I did before
See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors

Yo, yo, yo, yo, you know who this is, boy, for real
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P. B.I.G., nigga, R.I.P. P.A.C. 
R.I.P.—Enough of that shit, it's time to O.D. 
Don't take this shit serious, we just bugging the fuck out
One time
But y'all can take it how y'all want it, word

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is: I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell, I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight? I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan, tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha
Come up off that watch now, I mean, right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob O.D.B., but that'd be a waste of time (Yeah)
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold—like four mil? He got something to live for (Uh-huh)
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like ""Dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more, where you getting chips from now?""
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah, for real, son, I'm sick
I'm 'bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now, I'm bent, and when I get like this, I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight-ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece and run (Uh-huh)
This nigga weigh four hundred pounds—how he gon' catch me, son? Huh?
[Chorus: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga? (Tell 'em, son)
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like, ""You, give me the cash; you, put the hotdog down""
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before (Uh-huh)
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? ""Fuck you, pay me!"" (Yeah)
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down? Well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave (Uh-huh)
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny-ass rings (What)
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroner's picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, ayy, nigga, I saw you
He said, ""Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for you!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all; he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
""One at a time, get out and take off your shine""
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens (Yeah)
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough—I told him, ""Gimme some more""
If you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people, what!
[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga? (Tell 'em, son)
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
Yo, yo, for real, son, it's The Madd Rapper, you know what I'm saying?
And for real, you know what I'm saying, niggas just got to get stuck up, yo—that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It really don't matter—if you got it and I need it, I want it
You know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down
50 Cent ain't fucking around
Trackmasters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around
The Madd Rapper ain't fucking around

Cadillac grills, Cadillac mills
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy-paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
20-inch wide, 20-inches high
Ho, don't you like my 20-inch ride?
20-inch thighs make 20-inch eyes
Hoping for American 20-inch pies
Pretty-ass clothes, pretty-ass toes
Oh, how I love these pretty-ass hoes
Pretty-ass, high-class, anything goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty-ass bows
Long john drawers, long john stalls
Any stank puss make my long john pause
Women on their cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's balls

All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the floor, nigga, throw dem bows
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties with a matching ass
With your fly-ass boots or your open-toes

Dirty South mind blowing Dirty South bread
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South gurrls give me Dirty South head
Hand-me-down flip-flops, hand-me-down socks
Hand-me-down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50-pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
40-Glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth, you could find your mouth cold
And rip out your tongue cause of what your mouth told
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the 3rd degree
And if you sweat in your sleep, then you sweat from me

Keep your girl close cause she's a hit, by far

Rabbit out the hat, pulling Afro tricks

Okay people, welcome me back
It's been a hell of a year, but I'm healthy and back
Long time no see, huh? Where I been, where I be, huh?
In the street, huh
Now I'm back to ride this horsey like, ""Yee-ha!""
Yee-ha yee-ha, giddy up now
To the sound of the touchdown, A!
I just scored a touchdown, yay!
And I sit in a déjà, twisting the hay-ja
I don't listen to rap, I listen to 'dre, I listen to ""Hey Ya""

Everything that got to do with party music
Well, I ain't in a damn partying mood

Everybody raise your #2 pencil up! Now lay your #2 pencil down!
And that's your career, after a year, so glad that I'm here

No 6:15 this year, yeah, you can stay the night
We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Dig in their shit
And they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge
I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil Debbies
And when you're done, get ready
The chicks I was fiending to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that player shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
That still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her a mami

Love the way I push my slang
Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave

I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sipping on 'zae
Spitting up in the Pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love you, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her. Look at your honey slipping away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space

Exhibit A Transformations,rap,Jay Electronica,2009,181007,{},"[Intro]
And his own story was as curious as his narrative
The tale of his life is the tale of a writer of incredible vision
An astute analyst and pundit
A lyricist compassionate and callous
A reckless hedonist and disaffected malcontent

I spit that, Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerates
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Get that type of media coverage Obama get
Spit that Kurt Vonnegut
That blow your brain, Kurt Cobain, that Nirvana shit
Who gon' bring the game back?
Who gon' spit that Ramo on the train tracks?
That gold rope, that five-finger ring rap, running with my same pack
You can find the Christ where the lepers and the lames at
Life is like a dice game
One roll could land you in jail or cutting cake, blowing kisses in the rice rain
Nice whip, nice chain, a closet of skulls
The stench is like slave blood at Providence Hall, yeah
They built my city on top of a grave
Nigga die, a nigga get high and watch the parade
Back in the early '90s, where they at, where they at
Get the gat, get the gat was a popular phrase
Bally Animals and Rugbys was a popular craze
This the vivid memoirs of a obnoxious slave
I pave ways like Nat and Harriet
I blast on Judas Iscariot and peel off in the chariot, uhh
I'm sitting pretty, spitting flames, gripping grains
Ain't a damn thing changed

My dear boy, do you ask a fish how it swims? (No)
Or an eagle how it flies? (No)

Is the most enormous miracle of the machine age
Behold! A confectionery behemoth!

They say Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream
Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream
Knock a man's house down and build a casin'
A two thousand dollar government check from FEM'
I swam down shit's creek and came up clean
With a new lease on life like Andy Dufresne
It's the most poetical, Nat King unforgettable
Clarence 13X Allah's rhapsody from Bellevue
I'm splitting atoms, spitting flames
Bringing change, things will never be the same
I got the rap game singing At Last like Etta James
Lames get they plane shot down like John McCain
It's a dream, it's a dream
The flow is elegant like Miss Coretta Scott King
A lot of kings seen death and turn queen
Crack they twenty-four-inch rims in the ravine
Respect the architect, never test the Elohim
Goodnight, this is Jay Elec, live from New Orleans

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
[Outro]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

A Week Ago,rap,JAY-Z,1998,167220,"{""Too \\$hort""}","[Intro: Jay-Z & Too $hort]
Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry..
And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Beatch!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: ""Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said: ""Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said: ""The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: ""I'm never going back""
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, ""This is my dad?""
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Outro: Too $hort]
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghettos
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT
If you didn't snitch, beatch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it goin' on
We got the money
Ain't got nuthin' to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizin'

Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito

Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel

I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

Skatin' through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin'
No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, tryin' to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greetin' me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursin' the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, winter's here, I'm tryin' to feel mink, nig-ga

[Chorus]
Politics as usual
[Verse 2]
I took my Frito to Tito in the district
Blessed me with some VS
Somethings I can live with: stop frontin'
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true
I'm takin' wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
I'm smokin' bros who pump Willie, I expose
The furthest you Chiles been is the Poconos
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please
10-year felon, heavy on the wrist, I faze yous
With the diamond flooded Jesus and blind your facials
For life... sharight, Jigga, I keep it tight, nig-ga

You feel my triumph never - feel my pain
I'm lyin' low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came
The game changes like my mind just ain't right
Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember
Tellin' my family: ""I'll be back soon""; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Check baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that

Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time
(Yo! Start the show! Start the show!)
Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that lil tape of yours, and it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil freestyle?
Put that champagne down, and kick a lil freestyle for me tonight

Well I'm gone... check this out

Too much West Coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes

Exercisin' your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin'""
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Let's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga
Here's a thou', A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break 'em for nobody
Hah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)

Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wine down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc', I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard
[Interlude]
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
Cashmere baby

Cashmere baby

Sho' yo right, sho' yo right

Check it out, check it out
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The star player, the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sho' yo right
I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight?
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right

Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling, we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Preemo, got it sewed across the board like Pokeno
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella

Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

Bring it on if you think you can hang

Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce, heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Regrets,rap,JAY-Z,1996,146989,{},"[Intro]
Stress...
Sunshine, shade, geyeah

[Verse 1]
I sold it all, from crack to opium
In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin' the whole situation, like, ""Damn!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)
[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Verse 2]
As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin'
In search of higher learnin'
Turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction
My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'
Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it
You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin'
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him
Trapped, within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets
[Chorus 2]
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
(When I was young) you used to hold me
Told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Verse 3]
I found myself reminiscin', remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy
I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend?
Well, me and him feudin', on your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much
[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

Is y'all niggas finished?
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga? Huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, yo, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, yo... yo I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out
Scream ""what's that about?"", then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, 'til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?
[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns, stack ones yo
Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo
Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
What you want, what you want nigga?

We about to change this game here
Check my pockets ain't nothing but game there
I remain without fear
Keep the lames clear, and the cats that's all about scrap remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name is like a square
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the mystery, we get it swiftly
We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes
And the worst thing worst than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch the hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope they shine
Seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle
[Hook]
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you'll be a star

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Check this
In a mans world need a girl to tough something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home
Then it's on
Girl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226)
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks to stay out my business
You know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Bank still off on me
[Hook - Meli'sa Morgan]
But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Ever since you retired, working alongside of live wires
In this rap biz with fake nigs, you know liars
I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live
These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores guess what I'm saying I meant
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On the weight of me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!
But that's my cash, I understand you hustle
That's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle

Goin' on -- first they're guilty, now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this T.V
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each other's head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hang out

Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget, yeah
So step and fetch this shit

Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb, getting played like a sucker
Don't fight the power...(gunshot)..the motherfucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids, slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like, I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!

Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'

Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ahh)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson’s a] faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)

Guess who's bizzack? You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nothing with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball

Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off

Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)

A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch

Remember what you first told me when I took ya in. You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah). You wanted to be a killer (New York, stand up). You wanted to be the Champ! (Got your boy in the booth, nigga). You ain’t hungry. Matter of fact I don’t want you in my gym. Get out of my ring, you disgust me…

Godzilla bankroll, stones from Sierra Leone
Yo I ain’t got it all, that means I’m barely home
Trailblazer stay balling with vengeance
My arts is crafty darts, why y’all stuck on Laffy Taffy?
Wondering, how did y’all niggas get past me?
I been doing this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My Wallos I did ‘em up, them bricks I sent ‘em up
My raps y'all bit ‘em up, for that now stick ‘em up
10-4 good buddy, Tone got his money up
Worth millions, still bag your bitch looking bummy what
Y‘all staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire, you burning up like David Koresh
This is architect music, verbal street opera
Pop a Tec mad fluid, got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the Tunnel, terrorized speed
That’s when I was still in the jungle, slinging that D
[Interlude: Just Blaze]
*Bell rings* Get out my face! No you ain’t got no mo? Don’t need no has been messin’ up my corner. And you better get that mad look off your face for I knock it off. Hey, fool, you ready for another beating. You should have never came back. Look here man after I crucify him, you next! And you better have a good doctor to rearrange your face. I’m the Champ!

Who want to battle the Don?
I’m James Bond in the Octagon with two razors
Bet y’all didn’t know I had a fake arm
I lost it, wild and raw before rap, I was gettin’ it on
Took a fat nigga out in like 40 seconds
My gun get hard wit a 45 steel erection
Eagle on, Kangol half-slanted, Coconut Ballys from Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock, yo
Niggas want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging, frauds is left in they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenan Ivory Wayans
Stay in your place dirt poor rappers get shadow boxed for training
Y'all still eating bacon

[Interlude: Just Blaze]
*Bell rings* Think nobody can. Don’t give this sucker no statue, give him death. I told y’all I wasn’t going away. You had your shot no give me mine. Now why don’t you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man. You think you going to keep me down. They don’t want me to have the title. Because I’m not a puppet like that fool up there. Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed. I’m the Champ!

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I’m like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil’ on my left ankle
Terrycloth Guess shorts, robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch, that means I’ll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jagger, stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to a T, spark when weed went up
The coca leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gram Dukes’ tomato plants
And jets get chartered, marquee shit with the cars on it
The haters, they earl, run to the toilet and vomit
Back East, I’m a MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone, Iron Man, Bulletproof and Supreme
Kufi on, double deuce in the jeans
My man shape was on the floor with the mother lode, both of them green
IBF, WBC, cruiserweight, title shots, and rap belts belong to D.C.

Listen, I am bad, I said I am bad. I’m a bad man. I’m so bad sometimes I’s scare myself. Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself I’m so pretty. Now who am I? (The man) Now who am I? (The man) Who? (The Man) That’s right and don’t y’all forget it…

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
It's almost 10 o'clock, see, I gotta ball of lint for property
So I slip my beanie on sloppily
And promenade out to take up a collection
I got game like I read the directions
I'm wishing that I had an automobile
As I feel the cold wind rush past
But let me state that I'm a hustler for real
So you know I got the stolen bus pass
Just as the bus pulls up and I step to the rear
This old lady look like she drank a 40 of fear
I see my old-school partner, said his brother got popped
Pay my respects, ""can you ring the bell? We came to my stop""
The street light reflects off the piss on the ground
Which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round
Which reflects off the chrome of the BMW
Which reflects off the fact that I'm broke
Now what the fuck is new?
I need loot, I spot the motherfucka in the tweed suit
And I'm in his ass quicker than a kick from a greased boot
Eased up slow and discreet
Could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet
Didn't want to fuck up the come-up
So I smiled with my eyes said ""hey, how's it hanging guy?""
Bumped into his shoulder, but he passed with no reaction
Damn this motherfucka had hella Andrew Jacksons!
I'm a thief, or pickpocket - give a fuck what you call it
Used to call 'em ""fat cats,"" I just call them wallets
Getting Federal: ain't just a klepto
Mastercard or Visa? I gladly accept those
Sneaky motherfucka with a scam, know how to pull it
Got a mirror in my pocket, but that won't stop no bullets
Story just begun, but you already know
Ain't no need to get down, shit, I'm already low
[Chorus]
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

[Verse 2]
My footsteps echo in the darkness
My teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
I look down and I hear my stomach growling
Step to Burger King to attack it like a Shaolin
I never pay for shit that I can get by doing dirt
Linger to the girl cashier and start to flirt
All up in her face and her breath was like murder
Damn, the shit I do for a free hamburger!
Well you got my number, you gon' call me tonight?
It depends: is them burgers attached to a price?
I'm just kidding, I'ma call, even write you love letters
Thanks for the burgers, um, hook me up with a Dr Pepper
That's cool, you want some ice?
Yeah, and some fries would be hella nice
Damn my manager's coming, play it off, okay? 'Have a nice day!'
I'm up outta here anyway

I use peoples before they use me
Cause you could get got by an Uzi over an OZ
That's what an OG told me
Gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the Victuals that I just got
Came to a underground parking lot
""This place is good as any, fuck it, it's all good""
Walked in, found a car, hopped and sat up on the hood
Ate my burger, threw back my cola
Somebody said ""hey,"" it was a rent-a-pig, I thought it was a roller
""Want me to call the cops?"" I don't want them to see me
Looked down and saw that I was sitting on a Lamborghini
It was Rollses, Ferraris, and Jags by the dozen
A building door opened; damn, it was my cousin
Getting off of work, dressed up, no lie
Tux, cummerbund, and a black bow tie
I was like ""hey!"" ""Who is it?"" ""Me""
""Oh, what's up man, I just quit this company
They hella racist and the pay was too low""
I said ""right, what was up in there though?""
""A party with rich motherfuckas, I don't know the situation
I know they got cabbage, owning corporations
IBM, Chrysler and shit is what they said""
Just then a light bulb went off in my head
""They be thinking all black folks is resembling
Give me your tux and I'll do some pocket-swindling""
Finna change in the bathroom and not freeze off my nuts
Lets take a short break while I get into this tux

Alright, I'm ready

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

[Verse 3]
Fresh, dressed like a million bucks
I be the flyest motherfucka in an afro and a tux
My arm is at a right angle, up, silver tray in my hand
""May I interest you in some caviar, ma'am?""
My eyes shoot around the room there and here
Noticing the diamonds in the chandelier
Background Barry Manilow, Copacabana
And a strong-ass scent of stogies from Havana
Wasn't no place where a brother might've been
Snobby old ladies drinking champagne with rich white men
Alright then: let's begin this
Nights like this is good for business
Five minutes in the mix, noticed several different cliques
Talking, giggling and shit
With, one motherfucka in betwixt
And everybody else jocking him, throttling
Found out later he owns Coca Cola bottling
Talking to a black man, who's he?
Confused me, looking hella bougie
Ass all tight and seditty
Recognized him as the mayor of my city
Who treats young black men like Frank Nitti
Mr Coke said to Mr Mayor: ""You know, we got a process like Ice Ts hair
We put up the funds for your election campaign
And, oh, um, waiter can you bring the champagne?
Our real estate firm says opportunity's arousing
To make some condos out of low-income housing
Immediately, we need some media heat
To say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet!
Harass and beat everybody till they look inebriated
When we buy the land, motherfuckas will appreciate it
Don't worry about the Urban League or Jesse Jackson
My man that owns Marlboro donated a fat sum""
That's when I stepped back some to contemplate what few know
Sat down, wrestled with my thoughts like a sumo
Ain't no one player that could beat this lunacy
Ain't no hustler on the street could do a whole community
This is how deep shit can get
It reads ""macaroni"" on my birth certificate
""Puddin'-Tane"" is my middle name, but I can't hang
I'm getting hustled, only knowing half the game

Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slanging, keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare

Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses

Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child
[Hook: Natasha Walker]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 3]
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child
[Outro]
Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child…
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you’ll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven
If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you
Heh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime-a-dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody",330,en,en,en

H-E-A-D
All you washed-up hoes trying to throw that P
You're just a big freak, you better not complain
When you hear these cocktales and you hear your name
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine
If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm getting sucked in my drop-top Cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick-sucker, worked me and my homies
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vickie
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick
She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana'
I took her to my house and I told her ""strip""
Baby got freaky - started doing the splits
I said, ""Bee-yotch! Do what you want
Cause this true-blue mack won't even front""
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight it wouldn't give me none
I'm Sir Too $hort, baby, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one
I didn't fuck her freaky ass but it was still fun
I know you stop and wonder just what it is
It's the California lifestyle that I live
See I'm from the Crew, Dangerous, Bitch
I get on the mic and spit that freaky shit
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga, that's your bitch
I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy cause I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Every time she cross my mind I go fuck her again
She's like another freak named Christina
Bitch so dumb, I named her ""misdemeanor""
Cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch
And go dig in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screaming I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder

I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy
Fucking MC's cause she's so nasty
See her backstage trying to throw that ass
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on vogues then I drop the bitch
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs
I know a bitch named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie
Angie called me up about 2 weeks later
Talking some shit about ""do me, player""
So I did her just like Tamara
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera
Next they told a bitch named Raquel
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was digging in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back, now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything, cause I came to pimp
I'm Too Short, baby, I don't stop macking
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rapping
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking 'em up like that, bitch
I know a bitch, her name was Sherry
I had to cut her loose cause she wanted to get married
Pussy so good and I do mean very
Sometimes it's shaved and sometimes it's hairy
I'm Short Dogg, ain't nothing nice
You ever make me mad and I'll fuck your wife
Have fun with your bitch and have her sprung on my dick
I guess I'll pull it out and just cum on your bitch
Like my other little tramp named Erica
Anywhere I want to fuck, that's where I fuck
Cause she's the freakiest bitch in America
And every time I get the pussy, I just tear it up

Ruff Ryders! (Let's go)

[Hook: Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
They say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D-Block near you

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though 'cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound, yo
Five minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming a nigga's salary
More lies than truth, definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body's technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening, catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out, come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

And the mother's raising the sons to turn into gorillas

And pattin' my back seat, haha, my pimp lyrical tactics
Just like a dirty kid flippin' on a matress
Now flex this...

(Verse 1, Twista)
Now I just be
On the front porch, with the torch, ready to scorch
Two women peepin me, cuz frequently I'm gone
In the zone, they havin' thoughts of freakin' me
Keepin' me company, bumpin' me for the frequency I'm on
They can see I'm a cool muh-fucka, kickin' it petty
Down with the Kango on my razor fade
Peanut butter complexion, two silly processions
Two Phillie's, a fifty sack of some reefers, and a razor blade
Like a game of Spades, cut the bullshit
These days was made, for me devise strictly games that paid
Women freakin me, greedy, lickin me, doin body graffiti
Throwin they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age?
The players in the Chi, Twista and Do Or Die
You not gon' relate if you vibin' on the shit I'm thinkin' up
The style of flow is a vocal calico
To show you with the mic I be speakin' of, afterwards we can uhh...
Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and Glock
Try not to pass the block, gettin' more high than a astronaut
Sippin' After Shock
I ball cuz of C-Wall and Rap-a-Lot
Let's keep partyin' to crash the spot
Plenty Henny for my crew, and I ain't even broke up half a knot
Keep on holdin' me, while I roll a B, we can ""Smoke and Ride""
And you can play with me to keep the passion hot
Don't you know how the money flow?

Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow

(Verse 2, Belo)
Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex
Fine gear, fresh car, heavy on the skin tech
Money clean like Windex
Givin' up the Ave. like a brother gonna pass up the ""Ho Check""?
Ho flexin' on the avenue, laid back sippin' a half a brew
So I see if I can have a fruit
A creep show acts a ho, when she thinkin bout me havin you
She laughin' too, and pass a few, B's around
Smokin trees til' the leaves come down
Should be callin' dame skeezer now, show em the paper
They be caught up at your crib with they pants'es down
But money maker want a triple take
Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight
See him ridin in the C-A, D-I, double-L, bumpin' A-C, always
Stackin' paper in tall ways
Pull 'em off the small ways
Waitin' for the ho's in clothes, and I'm supposed to be, all day
Parlay, parlay, in the door, that's how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
Don't you know...

Bend the block with the indo, blowin' out the window
Rolex on my side door, laid back in the slow flow
Gettin' paid as the night go
I see some fly ho, tell me where you crib at?
Where's the place we can get back?
Hit you on the phone, see if you all alone
So we can get it on, baby just kick back
Swiggin' brews and Perregnon
Thick chick with D magazines, bangin'
AK (to where) to the pen
And to tell all my niggas to keep it strong
They ain't got long (to what) to see
Where the niggas seein kick it where a nigga kick it
But where I go, Cadillac to the show
Po Pimp, fuck the dough, hit the stage and become wicked
Get the money and ride out, go back to the hide-out
Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out
I'mma pull my surprise out
Then my boys just slide out, but two girls were chasin'
Gettin' paid in Chicago, been doin' this since the nine-oh
Comin' up, put it up, on fine ho's
Let the money flow

And I'm pattin' my back seat
I pimp lyrical tactics, just like a dirty kid flippin on a mattress
Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit
Then We dip through the Chi, in a truck like a Lexus
Rollin' blunts, while ya bobbin' ya head to the censorship
While you waitin' for the next hit
Motherfucka makin' money just wanted to take a look at the Mid-West
Put my color in
Spend my money in the Souther-an
Motherfuckas steady stutterin', but I'mma come from the heart for start
To stop all the niggas, the bigger the trigger, the larger the dividends
Pimpin and deliverin', leave 'em shiverin'

He kept backing up I'm tryna draw him closeHe saying ""chill I know what I got for ya Los""
Give me a lil time a nigga got jammed in jailYou know my fam Jamel look like Sam CassellGot knocked with like 900 grams of scale
On 75 north Alabama saleI don't know the nigga don't give a damn as well
You no negotiator and I ain't SamuelI squeeze 2 then the chamber got jammed with shells
And they say life is a gamble well
Guess today was his lucky day
He gotta move now I know where the fuck he stay
Catch his little chick and fried up Kentucky way
Bet if he flashed that she know where the stash at

Bomb First My Second Reply,rap,2Pac,1996,292135,{Outlawz},"[Intro: Press Release]
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:

[Spoken: 2Pac]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, (huh) in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first
[Chorus: 2Pac]
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!
[Bridge: 2Pac]
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

[Outro: 2Pac]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

They must got a death wish
Cause they was on the road to the riches
Back in the day, but they got off on the exit
Real disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment, it's hard to digest it
These young niggas don't wanna get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on 'em, and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they living in the 80's
And shorties that they knew since they were babies turned crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody lookin' like they gettin' a couple dollars
Could fuck, suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winning, but everybody can't lose
The dirt's still there, funeral home ain't move
Going in, coming out gang affiliated
You'd rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood, you can't escape it
Dust smoking niggas walking 'round in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, the tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick-up kids come around when they sense that you rich
Candles and lizzle get lit when you get hit with the fifth
Niggas that used to hoop dream is now selling the piff
And they still ratting but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the Tec spit
Fuck around get your head, and your neck hit, looking for a death wish
[Hook]
Talking out your mouth, all reckless
To a nigga that you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops, and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood and realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga, whole style's on some next shit
And you violate 'em that's a death wish

Better hit right or get left hit

Kill him and get breakfast, neck slit

And I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
And I'm from the Mecca of the reckless with a record-breaking death list
The reckless and neglecters think the election won't affect us
I'm high above you, above law, above average
Niggas snitching, put niggas in a can like a beverage
Damn! I pop at your head, fuck up your memories
I put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah, if you don't remember shit you goin' remember this
I'm knocking niggas down this year, I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit

And most niggas rap about money but they be broke
My man went to Morehouse and had strong blow
So I had him pitching in Atlanta like John Smoltz
Nigga, money make the world go round
And a stack of it'll make a nigga girl go down, clown
Patron and Grey Goose get the bitch loose
And after the crew, I'll have her licking on her sis, too
We getting money where I'm from, nigga (Harlem!)
We getting tired of your chick, tell her pack her shit
Come and get her, put her onto some shit, and get her grind right
Get her mind right, fatten the ass and get her spine tight
I'm the flyest
Most niggas want a deal with Nike
I'm like, dumb nigga, I'm tryna buy it
I need percentages, I don't care who the hottest
Little nigga, I think big like Christopher Wallace
And I won't stop until my grandkids' grandkids sitting on dollars
And I ain't even a father, nigga, call me Your Majesty
Young, black and fly
And when it come to dough I got a Jewish mentality
Little fuck niggas still trying to battle me
I go in their mouth like I'm a dentist looking for cavities
I don't know why your mans hyped you with that battery
I'll hit your whole team with caps, and I don't mean salaries, nigga
Already got dough, now I'm chasing the power
I'm the statue, stand tall cause I'm replacing the Towers
And these niggas washed up now, they faces is sour
Mad cause they broke and lonely and I'm making them dollars
With enough divas to spread out to ten cities
I can throw assists all night like I'm M. Bibby
Harlem got a fucking reason to front now
Uptown, let's go, we got a reason to stunt now
I told Joey and Stack shit ain't intact
Captains lost our city now we gotta get it back
Nigga, you can take it how you wanna
But ain't nothing impress me for the last three summers
I don't give a fuck how disrespected you may feel
Nigga, see me when you see me
It's whatever, it's Jae Millz, motherfucker
[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
Nigga, the booth feel better when real 'round it
Still round it, dress square but a nigga well rounded
Grounded like I came home late on my curfew
And proved I was better than most niggas my first two
Lil' years in the mixtape league
Now it's bidding war time, I got a Bloomberg league
So the hood's overwhelmed
They know it's the voice of the hustle
Whenever they hear son up at the helm
Son give 'em hell like Daniel in The Advocate
The fans fiending for it, they got the addict itch
That's the bundles, put it all in your nose
These niggas is lil' me's, hear it all in their flows
Ho's, that's a topic you don't even wanna touch on
I face-fuck the ones you couldn't touch on
Hand brushed on see the denim, know what these 'bout
The Antik's, Red Monkey's, or Vi's out
Y'all bring the V's out, I can even splurge
GT's wasn't me so I'm leaning towards the Spurs
Leaning towards the furs a lil' more to my nature
Mink, coyote, fox all in the nature
I get it in blocks I'm the Seymour Cake-ster
I give it on the arm, you can get it from me
Cause if prices was any cheaper y'all be sellin' it for free
Paid 2-3 sell it for 2-2-5
McDonald's is making more for profit off Super Size
I spit the truth inside, niggas wrote the fake shit
These niggas practicing snitching, y'all on some jake shit
Millz spoke on it, I agree with him
Can't even spar with niggas, what's the reason for a gym
Ain't hot enough to even work up a sweat
I been fire since Wu days with The Purple Cassette
So when you mention my name these niggas get offended
No chain on, just a five star pendant
General of that Riot so Squadddd Up
Feeling real prestigious hopping out that Porsche truck
I'm on top of my game and still climbing
They're not fucking with him, can't even peel off his hymen
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
It's the nigga with the mask on that would yack dude for jewels
Ain't gotta say it, that dude the truth, make me put that tool to use
And these niggas that be in the game shakin like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
Not Tourrette's, gotta rep my team to the end
Lambos to Ferraris to the Beamers to the Benz
If I blam it'll kill, never ran never will
Only thing that bleed on me is these jeans on my Timbs
Hat low, it's not a weak link in my squad
I'm LL, in too deep, I'm thinking I'm God
Far as rappers, I'm thinking they're frauds
Call 'em all Rubix Cubes cause I really used to think they was hard
Ha! For once trust me, you don't wanna start problems
The pound will make you Eddie Curry with a heart problem
So if you on the block with only a few grams, man
Then you a bird nigga, Toucan Sam
And any beat, I'mma air that, rappers just gotta wear that
Fox Brown should be the only one that can't hear that
Hit you in the spine or the belly, gun on me
I ain't Sticky Fingaz, I ain't leave mine in the telly, smell me?
Thank god he ain't fucking wit that red line
Cause I'll murk any nigga that disrespect mine
If it wasn't Fed time, or lock up or rec time
Dude'll be a Daily News headline
You ain't the best, what memo got sent?
If you got dogs, what kennel they in?
So if you wanna get fresh like a Mentos mint
Then it'll tempt those men with clips longer than Leno's chin
There ain't no type of guts wit you
You Terrell Owens, them niggas that wear eagles
They don't even wanna fuck with you
Me, fam? I was pimping weed dirt
Back when niggas used to rock Simpsons t-shirts
I'll give it to any nigga, I mean any nigga
Big man or skinny nigga, dare a dude tempt me, nigga
Auto or semi, nigga; dump till it's empty, nigga
They don't even want you in New York -- you like Penny, nigga
Check the time -- it's around that hour
Little niggas, they ain't 'round that powder
They ain't super or Luigi or Mario, ain't found that power
Plus they couldn't spit fire if they found that flower
Cowards, know the toys bust loco
While they trying to dap my hand like the Boy's Club logo
And yea that 5 slide and clock
I'm the million dollar baby, but I won't die trying to box
Don't want a piece of the cake, I won't the pie and all
I don't believe 'em when they say that they supplying the raw
You don't move white, you lying, dog
That's a never-ending story without the white flying dog
Son, these dudes is broke, don't know the feeling of bread
They in debt, tampon niggas, still in the red
And the fans keep asking if ya man stopped beefing
I call 'em Mr. Fantastic, tell 'em, ""Stop reaching""
[Outro: Killa BH]
Ah-ha, stop reaching!
Killa BH, son!
I'm ready to rock
Yo, ah-ha
When I come through, I'm like...a something
I can't remember
I'm that nice
Like the spice
Ah-ha

[Verse 1]
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome
[Interlude]
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it

[Ad-lib: Flavor Flav]
So long now, have a good trip!
Yo, yo, who put this thing together, huh? Me!
Me, that's who!
Who I trust? Who I trust?
Me, that's who!
Yo, who you trust, man?

[Verse 2]
Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome
[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

[Verse 4]
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone

Hah, what, how real is this?
Uhh, uhh, how real is this?
What? Uhh, what?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We push the hottest V's, peel fast
Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be shakin' they sadiddy ass
And Prada be somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein' broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home screamin' the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin' Tyson
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense, don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles, bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm poppin' Magnums while Jigga bag somethin'
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CDs and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl; take girls, break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesús, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in the beards and mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, 'cept the number after the dot on the Range
Way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Caribbean sands with Rachel
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ""Ewww!""
Still tote steel, I'm tryin' to see five mil off the single, for real
You ain't fazin' the amazin'
While your gun's raisin', mine is blazin'
See you want see me all talkin' to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-A-Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MCs with mad dough, you know

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like, cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

Uhh, uhh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts and horseback
Ridin', decidin' cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper?
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug pass your brain
Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfielders
Half these rappin' cats ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em Dash like Dame

Second Round K.O.,rap,Canibus,1998,158447,"{""Mike Tyson""}","[Intro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man
[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin' that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin' clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin' off your body 'cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You drippin' with wack juice and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Interlude: Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack-ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul; rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is somethin' different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you somethin', you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse—fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say ""Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is.""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
Fuck that! 'Cause like Common and Cube, I See the Bitch in Yoo
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

Holding the mic with you, but dig right

Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's

60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee
Wintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke
Music blastin' and the Arab V blunted
Whip smelling like fish from 125th
Throwin' ketchup on my fries, hitting baseball spliffs
Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips
I'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys
Got the Montana booth in front of the store
Made my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank
The moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off
And tell the driver to stay put
Fuck them niggas on the block they shook, most of them won't look
They frontin', they no crooks they fuck up they own jux
Look out for Jackson 5-0 'cause they on foot
Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady with the shopping cart
She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost
She work for Kevin, she 'bout 77
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding
Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in
3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door
You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you
Why? Why you behind me leery?
Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you
You is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude
Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit
Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme
Cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you goin' carry it
Matter of fact, all the cash, I'ma carry it
Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott
This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?
These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son
Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice, big round onions on a T-bone steak
My stomach growling, yo I want some
Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knock at the door
Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you don't know me, blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie
No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you supposed to phone me
Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open, dude had his mouth open
Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'
Told him, ""Freeze!"" lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, asked him
Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get to smokin' you fast
His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon
Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot
The kick in the four-fifth broke a bone in her wrist
And she dropped the heat, ""Give up the coke!"", but the bitch wouldn't listen
I'm on the floor like, ""Holy shit!"", watchin' my man Frank get busy
He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz
He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'
Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared
Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air
Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon
The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad wounds
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between

Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach (Uh-huh)

Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me

We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook

My life in that man's hands while he just deciding

From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley (Uh-huh)
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely (Ugh)
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a jux
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now, he feel he undefeated, he mean it
""Nothing to lose"" tattooed around his gun wounds
""Everything to gain"" embedded in his brain
And me? I feel the same—for this money, you dying
Especially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science

We agreed—to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with MAC-millis
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican (Ugh)
Gloria from Astoria, I went to war with her peeps in '91
Stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place; long story, Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe (Haha!)
Now she breaking, ""Shut up! 112, what's shaking?""
""A Jamaican, some bitches, I swear they look gay
And a black Range Rover been outside all day""
If it's trouble, let me know, I'll be on my way
""Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed""

""Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice""
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
""Ron, pass the gasoline,"" the nigga passed me kerosene (Ugh)
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come two...
Opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway, waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door, we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast (Ugh)
She crying, headshots put her to rest
Pop open them briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot: sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol-gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement (Uh-huh)
They Range got towed, they double-parked by a hydrant

God damn
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known to break em' off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

[Verse 1]
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front
I'm out to get rich
'Cause life ain't nothin' but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama, hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
'Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck PacTel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Don't drink 8-Ball 'cause St. Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin' in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out 'cause I just don't trust 'em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""What up, loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke? Get in, nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps
For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said, ""Pappy, could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?""
I said, ""Yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex""
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles
We'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor
Joey Crack, buck 'em all if they move—
Noodles, shoot that fuckin' whore!
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
Little did we know that we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It'll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real, I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake
Smack you, then I whack you with my snub three-eight
[Verse 3: Big Pun]
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family's children
Like Amityville, and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's buildin' a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealin'
A villain without remorse who's willin' to out your boss forever
And take all the cheddar like child support

[Verse 4: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother, sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me; one of the best—might be even better
Leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowin' out your brains, gettin' richer
Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what?
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels (Jewels), cruisin' in the Land, bumpin' ""Cash Rules""
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryna pass through
That's true! (So who the next to get it?)
T.S. the best that did it
(Get it off your chest, kid, admit it, and it's…)

[Chorus: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!

Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot, nigga, what? Bring it, I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop
[Verse 5: Big Pun]
Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt
Take 'em feet-first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the First Amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight, I hold my rosaries tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina, más fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me ""Don Cartagena""
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police
Though you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat
And I'll leave you right there, so beware
It's rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun, speak, and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

[Verse 7: Big Pun]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin'
Catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TECs is in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-of-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down
[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine every time
Plus, I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it, go and get it; set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas 'til it's armageddon

No wonder you're struck in the boundaries
Wake up if you're lunging, I'm something, you're nothing (Release)
Now come see me grunting
I'm hunting for what emcees want
And I'm stomping my foot through your armies
They couldn't have stopped me with shotties
Oddity, why did he, why do these entire societies inside of societies
And survivors still remain alive (Release) emcees
Thriving to flow, opting to go
Five hundred and fifty-five syllables to go
Split em' with the subliminal intentional digital pro
Unlimited flows unriveted, inhibited, visited
Now you can't get rid of it like (Release) what is this
This magnificent, intimate, inner wit, in a minute finna be antonyms
In it with a gig, big fat heads like eggs Benedict
Pigs lick shit, rip with words and abysmal energy
It's time I (destroy the beast, release)

[Release Part 2]

[Verse: Saul Williams]
Inner breathlessness, outer restlessness
By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath
Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barter's bard, barb of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A mantra to fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit. Through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation

[Verse: Lyrics Born]
The heaven-sent benevolent medicine man reverend
Peddling deliverance that resemble amphetamines to
The residents in the meadow of pestilence
Who developed a chemical dependence on pessimism, now
Is he is, or is he ain't
The most distinctive speaker seeping through your sleepy speakers
Yes he is, oh, yes indeed
So distinguished, so close some people think he's half [?]
Ain't no secret, people, trust me it's mostly hustling
That moves me upstream but just focus on the unseen
Boasting and fussing, they both so unproductive
Suppose it go in my blood stream, Let me pose this question
Ask anybody, that's anybody
They'll tell you that the antibody to the petty
Potty mouth gossiping is
Success at something, to be the best at something
And not to stress the dumb shit, 'cause you ain't missing nothing
You got to
[Hook: Gift of Gab & Lyrics Born]
Motivate, accelerate, never wait, know your weight, throw away hate
Grow and make weight of your older days
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate
Just motivate, accelerate, never wait, show the way, no escape
Take hold and shift shape, live a longer day
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate

[Verse: Gift of Gab]
Astrologists, colleges follow this through the metropolis
The dominant brown bomber, I'm in it, being prominent
Walking it mean, talking it, clean the scene, stalking it

And always all day outlandish bandits
Be slandering what we mastering cause they can't catch us
They all pray for our downfall, maybe one day, sike!
You never get no balance if you're crooked so play right, snake
I'm mongoosin' on you, stormtroopin' through your form

On one chopping you, I'll tomahawk, trauma hawk
Long running champ and rocking shit 'till I'm gone
You're a Tom Thumb and I'm King Kong Bundy strong
Thunder all summer long, keep on coming dawn
Dusk, night, morning I'll bust tight poems
Raw, just mic zoning ya'll with the right mode of motivation

[Verse 1 - DJ Quik]
Well 1991, I was rockin' my jheri curl, just a young gun
Lookin' for the bitches that have alot of fun
Just dropped a hit record now I'm under the sun
Winter time night fall cold as hell
Standin' outside of the Goldentail
Hella hoes mobbin' in pushin' gettin' through
Tiger striped cat suit looking at me too
I asked her ""what's your title"" and she said it was ""V""
Vanessa you impress a nigga, can't you see
What you doin' later can I kick it with you?
She said it all depends on what you wanna do
Took me to her buddy's house, walked in the room
Buzzin' off the kamikaze that I consumed
Talk, kiss, grind tyrin' to get get my balls off first
She said nigga can you take my draws off first
I was young I admit it
She told me I was horny and wild, but still let me hit it
Hot bare back until I felt that quake
She told me shoot that milk shake, shoot that milk shake
Goddamn I dont wanna get sprung
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy
Ran home to tell my nigga Top
About this cock that just wouldn't stop, yeah
I told him she was greeneyed light skinned and fly
He said he met a bitch like that last july
A car pulled up and it was her no doubt
I told him thats who I'm talkin' about
He said that's who I'm talkin' about damn
Hook

[Verse 2 - AMG]
Now here's the plan
In the home of the one night stand
Rolled up in a stretch
Pussy to catch
Plus now I'm sittin' the V.I.P
And hoes wanna suck on the D.I.C, OK
So here's the play give me OJ and Tanqueray
Have you had you dick today
Is what im thinkin
But i've been drinkin
I see you peepin me out
And its freakin me out
Cause she fine than a motherfucker about 5'8
135 and I just can't wait (for what)
To hit the backside,and get the top love
Buck naked in the hot tub
Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you)
The flyest nigga in the rap biz
And they're playin' my song so a nigga gotta go and uh
Put a ho in the limo
She was askin' me question after question
Until she seen my life size erection
I bent her over prepared to do my duty
And seen my nigga Quik's name on her booty
Hook

[Verse 3 - DJ Quik and AMG]
Were running out of Beedies
Now who gon do the honors
I hit the liquor next to Benihana's
But on my way I met bitch as sqaure as a box
With a big ass booty and some goldie locks
And I ain't gotta do much talkin' she wet
Because she seen me movin' a '97 Corvette
The good thing is I never seen her around
So I took her to my spot to get down
Now AMG what you think about the bitch
She used to dance at the Jet Strip [AMG]
Shakin' the cock, 20 dollars a pop
A nick name babygirl, use to have a jheri curl
Now she got braids, ex-nigga paid
She use to roll a Lexo now she got a Pathfinder
Wear a rubber if ya get behind her
Cause my nigga told me she had the heebie geebies
Give her drank and dank she'll give a nigga freebies

Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hitting the deck, feeling heat in your chest
Banging your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for going where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doing my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be putting in work

Hey yo Cube, man, hey yo Cube, check this out
Yo, motherfuckers be on the dick and shit, right?
Check this out, you know what I tell 'em, man?

[Verse 1: Flavor Flav]
Well two peas in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it
Kiss my ass and suck the D.I.C.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and the butt was spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again in a field of grass
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said ""Run-DMC""
Yeah, and you don't stop
Flavor Flav in the house, and you don't stop
Ice Cube's in the house, and you don't stop
Hey, my sugar (Hey, yo, rock that shit G!)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hairdo
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her on key
Bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I'll just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like Raindance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said 'Will you call me?'
Yeah, I'll call you a bitch or a ho after I ball you
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang

IC: Yo, I'm only out for one thing
FF: You out for what, man?

Got My Mind Made Up,rap,2Pac,1996,227392,"{""Method Man"",Redman,""Tha Dogg Pound""}","[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
You find a MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
That make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with a .68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, assume to count the bodies

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate, and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to ""Rhythm Nation"", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games gettin' told
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alizé and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat
[Chorus: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on (Come on)
Get in, get into it (Get on it)
Let it ride (Get with it), tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into it (To it)
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse (Uh)
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees (Uh)
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall (Yeah)
Should already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator (Equation)
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
[Verse 4: Method Man]
Fuck you losers
While you fake jacks, I make maneuvers
Like Hitler stickin' up **** with German ****
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial (Yeah)
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my clans repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then tes-ticles
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse 5: Redman]
Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genital backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men, I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke
Choke off this antidote, got you hope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt

Cop weight, wait for a drought and then make it flood
Try to take my cake you gonna take a slug
But you can take my information if you taking drugs
'Cause I could sell Raid to a bug
I'm a hustler, I can sell salt to a slug, 'cause

[Verse 2]
I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gonna be two soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows
I made more dough on the grind than going gold
That's why I stay fly and I'm 'flage-ing on hoes
Floss is so cool, in Austin no shoes
Just a rubberband on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules and I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler, ask about me

[Verse 3]
To get paid you got a save dont be spending the change
In 5th grade I was hustling my Genesis games
I was dumb, young, selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
""More money, more problems"" is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude's voice, props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hot line, I made a hot song
So, stop drawing, man, you got to respect it
I'm the best, Swizz got to perfect it, don't mess with
C-A-double-S-I-D-Y
'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died
The Kid do it big like P-U-N

How High,rap,Method Man & Redman,1995,109496,{},"[Intro]
Takin' it from the top?
Top
Tippy?
Come on, my people
Sing it, daddy
Hey, yeah
Taking my mind where it's never gone before
And so like a mushroom in cow shit
And I'm taking it just to get the ultimate high, baby
The ultimate high

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture?
Stalk the dead body like a vulture, Ticalion, hmm
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo' Shaolin, my nigga
Now yes, Apocalypse now, the gun blaow
It be goin' down, diggy diggy down, diggy down, down
[Verse 2: Redman]
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more fruitier loops than that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus the Bombazee got me wide (Fucking with us)
Is a straight suicide

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four
Three, two, murder one lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breakin' all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mines to get yours
Fucker, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, I stays open like an all night store
For real I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D

[Verse 4: Redman]
I be's the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk used to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the dark side tears you into Hollywood Squares
Six million ways to die, so I chose
Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold cold so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your funky ass
Ayo, my man (Tical), hear me now (Huh)
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
They get me mad, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a licking off in hip-hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your Billboard spot?
[Chorus]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spot smoking buddha on a train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick

[Verse 5: Method Man]
'Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on 'til the Ruckus get home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed, we got our fuckin' own
Check it, I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screaming for the antiseptic
Moving on your left kid, and I'm Method
Out my fucking dome piece, plus I got no love for the beast
Hailing from the big East Coast, where niggas pack toast
Home of the drug kingpin and cut throats

[Verse 6: Redman]
Hey boy, you the rude boy on the block
You try to stop the bum rush, you will get popped
[Verse 7: Method Man]
As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, F a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

[Verse 8: Redman]
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Rico-chet Rabbit
I brings havoc with an A-K 'matic
Rollin' blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smith & Wes', who clique's the best?
Punks take a sip and test, who splits your vest?
The funk phenomenon, I'm bombing you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with or played with
Fuck them pretty hoes, I love those Section 8 bit-ches
Hitting snitches, twisting wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga-boo
Scared you, blew you to smithereens
Fuck the Marines, I got machines
That like to spit and read MAD magazines
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya five times like U.S. Air off an instrumental
Look, I'm not a halfway crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks 'em off proper
Ask Biggie Smalls who shot ya
Funk Doctor with the 12-gauge Mossberg
Look, I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
For the nine nickel

24 Hours to Live,rap,Ma$e,1997,56410,"{DMX,Diddy,""Black Rob"",""The LOX"",""Ma\\$e""}","[Intro: Puff Daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty-four hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

[Verse 1: Mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem World blow up be my last request
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money
To take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldie, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches in one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what?

[Verse 3: Black Rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bad Spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one of them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the Feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Pause, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, get them cats I wanted to get
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in '86
Went home, took a shower in ice cold water
And spend my last hours with my son and my daughter
[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
If you had twenty-four hours to live, just think
Where would you go? What would you do?
Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?
If you had twenty-four hours to live, just think
Where would you go? What would you do?
Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?

[Verse 4: Sheek Louch]
What, aiyyo, if I had twenty-four, nigga gotta get the raw
Run all in papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty and he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi, fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a book bag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there, grab the bank teller with the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty-three, I'ma be strapped with TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges with me

[Verse 5: Styles P]
If I had twenty-four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin' the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to Hell and bust down Satan
Styles on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty-four, I'll make it out the precinct
Shootin' niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent, get stocks and bonds
[Verse 6: DMX]
Twenty-four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste a lot of lives but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin' but I'ma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'ma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C4 up under the coat, snatch up my dawg
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
If you had twenty-four hours to live, just think
Where would you go? What would you do?
Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?
If you had twenty-four hours to live, just think
Where would you go? What would you do?
Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?
If you had twenty-four hours to live, just think
Where would you go? What would you do?
Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die?

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Pardon me, love, but you seem like my type
What you doing tonight? You should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed, play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown: Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I wanna fuck, and no doubt
But tonight we'll try a different route
How bout we start, with a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See, I ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me wanna show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just taking our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't trying to say I don't wanna fuck, cause I do
But for me, boo, making love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm getting into
[Chorus: stic.man]
It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

[Verse 2: M-1]
African princess, tell me your interests
Wait, let me guess, boo: you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certainly?
Cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floating out in space when you flirting with me
C'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract: that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the Yin from the Yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started, I ain't trying to stop
But first, we havin mind sex
[Chorus: stic.man]
We ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
It's time for some mind sex
We ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Mind sex

[Outro]
She smiles; I smile
She walks - no - she glides softly by me, changing night into day
She opens her mouth to speak
And so sounds ring in my head
She speaks, and I want to dance to her rhythm
She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires
As I place my arms around her waist
Hold and squeeze unto me
I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth
Her beautiful black body that no human mind could ever conceive
She's love, she's truth
She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens
As real as the sun that bathes her body
As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose
That blossoms in Spring - for she is that rose
And not just any rose, but a black rose
Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant
A black rose, that stands as Creator
Of nations of black roses
That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round
Black rose, sweet rose, thornless rose, eternal rose
Please look my way
Please look my way
Please look my way

Presto, read the Communist Manifesto
Guerillas in the midst, a Guevara named Ernesto, so
(E-Roc: What a brother with a Afro know?)
Yell go and flow for the mack and we're the ho
So grow cause the lynching brothers might get hung
Rhetoric flowing from the tip of my Mao Tse Tung
Deficit (E.R.: money spent) catch the glint
(E.R.: of my 9 as they cut welfare 25%)
And I dissent, as I clench and raise my fist
(E.R.: We did away with that) so you could get with this
Here’s a twist cause we’ll overthrow like Kwame N’krumah
Spread around the wealth as if it were a vicious rumor
Pam cuts a record like a surgeon cuts a tumor from a brain
(E.R.: We’re all cooped up so feel the pain)
From 400 years of exploitation
Anesthesia provided by your local TV station
Patience is not a virtue (E.R.: I ain’t waiting)
Turn this shit over like Bush did a boatload of Haitians

[Verse 2]
How now brown cow, I’m down with the Mau Mau
Clown downtown tried to put us in the dog pound
Like H. Rap Brown with the situation
(E.R.: Won’t get no callouses) cause I’m spitting dialectical analysis
So how is this, we never had no funk
Until you found out that our joints are revolutionary, huh?
(E.R.: Chump!) bump you over like dominoes, rat
(E.R.: So free Geronimo Gi Jaga Pratt!)
Lyrics hear it fear it can’t get near it
Got a sample didn’t clear it
Point blank says ""fuck 5-0!"" That’s the spirit
Cheer it, spat out, the fat that I consumed
Knew that I was doomed since my date of birth
To be the wretched of the earth; never had a dream that was American
(E.R.: There go that lady chair again) despair again
(E.R.: But that ain’t nothing new)
Told the streets were paved with gold
Whoever paved that shit got minimum wage too!
Do you understand, the metaphoric phrase?

(E.R.: Gunned us, stunned us) exploited and they hung us
I’d like to take a moment to say, fuck Columbus!
(E.R.: Millions off my back) the black on black crisis is a myth
The crack that did the damage (E.R.: was the one from the whip)
The record skip, the record skip, the record skip *scratch*
The record skips, cause my voice is kinda scratchy
From yelling, ""don't shoot!"" when 5-0 comes to harass me
They never pass me, no one to go and tail bro
(E.R.: Trying to kill the movement with the new COINTELPRO)
Leaders they killed, if I said it, it would threaten em
They only see my back because I’m three steps ahead of em
We’re not falling in the slot you slated
(E.R.: We realize that our power’s nickel-plated)
Masses move as well as asses do, class is through
Our time is over, past it’s due

Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga

Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style

With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'

No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off

How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack

[Verse 1]
I'm obnoxious, motherfucker, can't you tell?
Run through Little Havana, yellin', ""¡Viva Fidel!""
Jerkin' off with the sheets when I stay at hotels
Drinkin' Bacardi; AA meetings, smokin' a L
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Like workin' for white people after watchin' Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture, nigga? I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12-year-old girl
Let's face it, you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Gimme a hundred grand! Gimme your watch! Gimme your chain!
That's your girl? Bitch, get over here! Gimme some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after the segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, tryna get herself pregnant
I said it, I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war when niggas know that you puss
A fuckin' hypocrite, draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me, nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around ya head
Send a dead fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off, nigga, so get the fuck out my way!

Now that I'm gettin' closer and closer, I know that you feel it (Yeah)
You're eatin' off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said Hip-Hop was dead, but I'm invokin' a spirit
We takin' it back in the day to the Golden Age
When wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this to bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet and bump it outside

We keepin' it live, we keepin' it live
Burn it off the fuckin' Internet and bump it outside (Yeah nigga!)

[Verse 2]
Look, motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A ragin' alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgustin' flow, like third-world-country tap water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
'Cause I'ma prank call COP-SHOT just for kicks
Payback for every time that they called me a spic
And Puerto-Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco
And Dominican women call me the ""Rompe Toto""
They call me ""ocioso,"" I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work, and we makin' the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize the way that I spit?
You coffee-shop revolutionary son of a bitch!
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay?
When niggas speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say
You don't know shit about a dead man's perspective
And talkin' shit'll get your neck bone disconnected
Disrespected, niggas don't show no love
Why you tryna be hardcore, you fuckin' homo thug?
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
'Cause if you can take a fuckin' dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you to prove that you've fallen off
And you won't do shit about it like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire

Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""

It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds

Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...]
[Yeah!]

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus

But Long Island was Jesus every weekend
Spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing
Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they'd SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies [Well...]
Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a [FUCK!]

[This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and
Helpful to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people:
'Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food. When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.'
But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you?
Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered:
'In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren
You have done it unto me.']

Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools

Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level 'til Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne & Eminem Eminem]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

I never let you down, I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard I'm gonna ball, on them squares I float
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing, they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back!

[Verse 1]
Strike a match, catch a fire
Any moment I decide that's enough of all your lies
Boy, your buzz just died
Step inside, super-fly, to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
Cause these guys, they don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts dancing on the screen
There's a drought of real niggas in the game, so it seems
Just pretend to holla, pimping, give the shit a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I’m like: ""why?""
Be yourself; you ain't got a pimp bone in your body
I can tell you ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane
Me and Boosie all go to prison
Now he flipping hoes, every nigga tripping
Listen dude, for you that ain't in the cards
Thank the power's in the guns
But overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don’t know what's up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way:
Violating. I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it? And I promised I would put you on point
I’m disappointed in you, dogg, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going at your jaw, just going to show you how to ball
Standing tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for them

Strike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass
Still I am, partnas want to come for me you better bring it
I ain’t mad I forgive them, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't
Wrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can’t
Ain't that lame, but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I’m no longer being callous, I’m gonna let you niggas have it
Won’t be satisfied until somebody dies and I'm patiently waiting on
Me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I’m a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too
Hating in your blood, Cuz. Yes, it’s just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt Joyce
Hey, you can have the bottom, partner I'm up in the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
I'm so above you, hover over suckers why drop down
I’m so profound, it goes down, and I never let you down

(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)

You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

Rikers Island,rap,Kool G. Rap & DJ Polo,1987,3043,{},"[Intro]
Well listen to me, you young hoods, this is some advice
You do the crime, you're payin the price
Cause if you're in the drug spots, sellin crack on the block
Snatchin chains, bustin brains, like a real hardrock
If you ever hear a cop say you're under arrest
Go out just like a trooper, stick out your chest
Cause you might have been robbin, you might have been whylin
But you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND

[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
Just to hear the name it makes your spine tingle
This is a jungle where the murderers mingle
They say the place is crowded but there's room for you
Whether you're white or you're black, you'll be black and blue
Cause in every cellblock, there is a hardrock
With a real nice device that's called a sock lock
Don't ever get caught in a crime my friend
Cause this bus trip is not to Adventure's Inn
They have a nice warm welcome, for new inmates
Razors, and shanks, and sharp edged plates
Posses will devour, punks with power
After the shower it's, rush hour
So watch your back before you get sacked
These a bunch of maniacs that's about to attack
If you're a hustlin pro, keep a low profile'n
Cause you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND
[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
C-74, adolescents at warPut your ear to the floor, you can hear the roar
They take you out of BC, they now found you a cage
All eyes are glued to you like you're up on stage
If you're soft as a leaf, don't get into a beef
And God be with you chief if you got gold teeth
Some try to be hard, front and say I'm God
Don't know a lesson say a blessin, you're gonna get scared
(Yo call the C.O.) That won't be necessary
He'll watch him beat you down, and take your commissary
Inside the lunchroom, you meet your doom
Someone is lookin at your sharper than a tablespoon
Use your hands like a man, don't go out like a chump
Never 'fess, bench press so that you can be pumped
If you don't got a game, you get beaten and slain
And scared as a mouse in a house of pain
So to all the jailbirds that listen to hip-hop
Move your pelvis like Elvis do the Jailhouse Rock
You might be coolin, you might be stylin
But you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND

If you're on a drug tip, don't be a Dumbo
Police investigate like Columbo if they think you're sellin jumbo
But don't get me wrong, it might be your thing
Whether smilin on the Island, or singin in Sing-Sing
The way you're takin pictures and you're givin a smile
Cheerin, the priveledge for a long long while
So keep your money pilin, keep profilin
Cause ahh, you won't be smilin on Riker's Island",336,en,en,en
A Million and One Questions Remix,rap,JAY-Z,1998,41585,{},"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No...

[Verse 1]
A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only your single going gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for a O?
For the millionth time asking me questions like Wendy Williams
Harassing me, then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol', ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh! Nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in ""Friend or Foe,"" and if so, what block?
What you doin' in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses
Latinos in Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all y'all questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, ""How bad you wanna know?""
BLAOW!

'98, Preemo remix, and ain't nothing different
I don't know what the hell, niggas been sniffing
Jigga still dipping, chrome on the whips and
Four days out the week, find me in the kitchen
Still in the game, nigga, hooked like glue
Papi gave me one pie, but it cook like two
I'm a crook like you
Cats around my way was buying brand new whips and shit
What could I do? Knowin I'm supposed to style
I'm the hustler's poster child, rock lizards and cro-codile
Live ironic and what-not
Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot
Now you see me on them stages, rocks in the air
Looking like blue lasers, never fugaz-es
Act courageous, I smack 'em with the two aces
MAC double one, nigga, I'm troublesome
All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum
Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
It's the Roc-A-Fella clique, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thang nigga, we doing our damn thing
BLAOW!!!

(A million) How we do, come on

Sounds so beautiful, don't you agree, ladies and gentlemen?

[Verse 3]
Ha! Well they call me Jay-Hova 'cause the flow is religious
And ever since I was 16, I was holding digits
I'm seeing this industry clearer
As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror
I slow-flows y'all to death
So y'all hoes know who's best—Jigga!
The flow be Ay, Bendito
For the mamis I hable español, poquito
Oh Este, I got timing like a segue
Now holla back, baby!
Uh-huh-huh, Jay-Z, you motherfucking right
In the darkest nights let off my gun for light
To guide y'all through, show you how it's done
I'm The Question and The Answer like Iverson
Jets be private ones, no gate to lift
So when I take flight, it's from Hangar 6
Bang with this, wake up with one in your brain
And the cocaine flow's straight numbing your pain
This ain't your speed, young mayne, run in your lane
So I can come through doing a hundred and change
I put one in your frame—picture that
Who's running the game? Let's get to that
I guess we one and the same
A million and one... once again
Novacane flow, ho, you ain't know
Like a baller in an Impala, Jigga remain low
Then I pop up, and tear your block up and kick off like soccer
In a Range Rove, twist hoes like ankles

When I shoot, Fuhrman scoot; I'm yelling, ""Gimme all the loot!""
Bourgeoisie pimping me, now my digits don't compute
Chilling in a house of ill repute

I feel my epidermis at it's firmest just before a skirmish
If you want green like Kermit keep it heated like a Thermos
Aspired to be famous, putting fire in their anus
Made the ruling class hate us more than child support payments
To Rosemary's Baby; shick-a-shick-shady!!
Pissing in your gumbo and they tell you, ""It's all gravy!""
See, you can't trust a big grip and a smile
And I slang rocks, but Palestinian style
Now there's a rumble in the jungle -- never mumble though I'm humble
Couple rappers took a tumble but my folks still want to rumble
Who's pimping your bundle? I'm fly like Seth Brundle
If you're snitching to Columbo we gon' drop you like a fumble
Now what you make is point-oh-one percent of what the boss make
And what the boss take is keeping us from living great
If this ain't straight you think you wanna sit down and negotiate
You better have a crew to help you shut down his estate
Don't get frustrated, discombobulated
Don't stand and debate it, get a mob and take it!
'Til then it's food stamps, vouchers, mildew-smelling couches
Overturned garbage cans with no Oscar the Grouches
Making money selling plastic pouches
As Mystikal would say, ""My flo' is covered wit' roaches!""
Absotively, posolutely, can't do without it
The Shipment is delivered, come and get it if you 'bout it!

Marcy projects hallway loiterer
Pure coke copper, get your order up
I bring 'em to Baltimore in the Ford Explorer
But it's gonna cost you more if I gotta get 'em to Florida
Rucker game attender, with the Bent parked
On the sidewalk with the temp plates on the fender
I ain't hard to find you catch me front and center
At the Knick game, big chain in all my splendor
Next to Spike if you pan left to right
I own Madison Square, catch me at the fight
With Cam, once again if you pan left of his ice
It be the man that write checks with the hand that don't write
I go, off the head when I'm rambling on the mic
And I throw, off the Feds when I'm scrambling at night
And it was often said I brought hammers to the fight
But we from New York City, right Cam? (Ya damn right)

Two on the waist, two on the ankle, two to just spank you (faggot)
You get jammed with them jammers
Blammed with them blammers
Hot here, ask Mase he ran to Atlanta
You think you know what life do, mink on the motor-cycle
Trinkets they so delightful, blinging in so much ice fool (bling!)
In front of Sparks body Castellano
Block away watch by Gotti and Gravano
It's la costra nostra, someone close approach ya
They'll toast ya: gopher, bread loafer your chauffeur (over)

I'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze
Flows all night like vintage Dom
Been this nice since umm, the first Prince bomb
Before ""The Artist Was Known As"" wit my grown ass
Haters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past
Celly on roam, full belly, first class

His whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb
Pull up my tights some, enticin him

Me and Jesus the Pimp in a 79 Granada Last Night,rap,The Coup,1998,15911,{},"[Verse 1]
Well, he was smilin' like a vulture as he rolled up the horticulture
Ignited it, and said, ""I hope the vapors don't insult ya""
What I replied denied, but he mixin' weed and hop
His head was noddin' up and down like he agreed a lot

Bored said, we need a plot, I comply, let's leave the spot
Hopped in the Granada, he's impressed by the beat I got
His name is Hey-Zeus but his pimp name is Jesus
Slapped a ho to pieces with his plastic prosthesis

""Nigga, don't you know that I'm your daddy"" said he
This is true, plus he schooled me for my mackin' degree
Never plea, try not to flee, make niggas pee when you stick around
This man my momma had found taught me to put it down

I press the gas to the ground to show that I'm a hound
Makin' sure that get rubber sound is heard throughout the town
Thirty years ago, Jesus could pull a ho quick
But now he's fifty and his belly hang lower than his dick
Philosophy that he spit stuck in my memory chips
And now he puttin' in a disk of Gladys Knight and the Pips
Then that shit starts to skip, he said, somebody must have scratched it
Put the forty to his lips and poured the contents down the hatchet

Well, since my adolescence, 'cause of his pimp lessons
Smack my woman in the dental just for askin' silly questions
Relationship reduction to either rock the box or suction
Ain't got no close partners, socially I can't function

From the pen he would scribe on how to survive
Don't be Microsoft, be Macintosh with a Hard Drive
Used to tell me all the time to keep a bitch broke
Did I mention that my mama was his number one ho?

Clunked the forty on the floor and placed his palm on the dash
And wheezed out, ""Come on man, make this motherfucker mash""
Ain't gonna mash too fast, 'cause my tags ain't right
Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night

Oakland, do you wanna ride?
I can't hear you, Oakland do you want to ride tonight
Oakland, do you wanna ride?

[Verse 2]
City lights from far away can make you drop your jaw
Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras
There's beauty in the cracks of the cement
When I was five, I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent

Whatever it was that could break my momma's back
Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac
And matter of fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract
And on the track, she went from beautiful to battle axe

And back at home, she would cry into her pillow
Vomit in the commode, I was six years old
I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold
Never knew how she was sufferin' for my food and clothes

She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread
I said, ""He's missin' an arm, and he seem like a pee-pee head""
She said, don't cuss and my teeth to go brush
And get ready for bed and the toilet to flush

With tears in my mama's eyes, I was her everything
Before she went out on the stroll
She'd tuck me into bed and sing
""You're just too beautiful for words
You're just too beautiful for words
You're just too beautiful for words
You're just too beautiful for words""
[Verse 3]
I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies
Reminds me of midnight in a dope fiend's eyes
And my nine-year-old self as paramedics leave
Left to bawl my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve

To give illustrations that are clear and clean
I'll take you two hours back, before this scene
Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep
When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep

Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink
Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini and fake mink
Even though she served for fifty dollars-a-pop
Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped

That day the landlady got her rent before he got his knot
Slammed mama's head against the front bolt lock
Then the pimp with one arm done harm
Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm

Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin'
Heard the blap blap of twenty head crack percussion
And body blows, her body froze from bolos to the spine
I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine

She didn't even have the strength to say, ""I love you, Boo""
But I said it to her and she knew that I knew
She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case
But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face

Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions
Go to Frisco, I got very friendly vocal inflections
Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight
Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night

[Verse 4]
The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world
Or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled
My temperature gauge read, cold and blistery
Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphalt history

This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary
Fifteen years, but it seem like a century
See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama
Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp, comma

You accidentally killed my moms, no player hatin' points
You know how bitches act, shit, exclamation point
First it was a set up move, then it was the truth
His letters were the only friends that I had as a youth

But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit
So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick
'Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus
To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers

And I don't think that it's gonna end till we make revolution
But who gonna make the shit if we worship prostitution?
Ain't no women finna die for the same old conclusion
Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em

Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery
Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery
Jesus said, ""Why the hell you pointin' a gat
So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat

I said, ""This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on
This is for my mental and my mama that I cried on
Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones
But since I'm Macintosh, I'mma double click your icon""

He struggled for life, then gave up the fight
Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night

Knowing I can go just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches

No father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga

Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter, y'all niggas better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion just to rock it down
You hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?
And throw away the key
But without this drug shit, your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh?
We still try to keep mom, smilin'
Cause when her teeth stop showin'
And her stomach start growlin' then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood, I know you feel me (Keep goin')
If a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start working, I'ma rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open
And I'ma get him (Keep flowin')
We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off a record, bail my niggas outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smith 'n
But I'm never snitching, I'm a rider
If my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wilding 'til they pick me out a line-up
Even though what we do is wrong
We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wild out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it
I'm not tryna visit the morgue
But Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord
'Til I, get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the morning
And I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawning mang
Even though what we do is wrong
Still deliver the order mang
And I ain't talking 'bout chicken and gravy mang
I'm talking bout bricks of yayo, halves and quarters
Fou and a halves of hash, you do the math
Swing past us, scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll with a thug that rap, you do the math
He gon' blast 'til my stacks in order mang!

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask, air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's sticking out
Y'all don't want to witness shit, we squeeze hammers mang
Bullets breeze by you, like Louisiana mang
But I gotta feed Tianna mang
So I move keys, you can call me the Piano Man

You, know, B. Sige' in the third lane
Gramps still praying, working on my nerves man
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane""
But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pour out beers for our brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers
Shit, I'll probably be wilding with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Anajmah that I'm riding for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother, different father
Any problems dawg, know I got 'em
And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy on Dollar Day
Real gangstas make hood holidays

Tell the gang I never break my promise mang

You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
[Chorus: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh uh uh
It's big pimpin' baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese

We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T

We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese

I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Sittin' in the living room on the floor
Hunger pain got me on some migraine shit
But I'm a maintain
Nigga got two or three dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat going through the same thing
Ready for the caper, steady plottin' for the paper
We been livin' in the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a twenty-five automatic added to the gamble
Nigga get the phonebook look up in the Yellow Page
Lemme tell you how we finna to get paid
We gonna order pizza and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the twenty-five up in his face
Let's ride, steppin' outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hidin' in the corridor until we see the Dominos car headlights
White boy in the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes
You know what this is, it's a stick up
Gimme the dough from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggas
We runnin' down the block hot with these pizza boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

Hell yeah, you wanna get paid my nigga
Hell yeah, ain't you tired of starvin' my nigga
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: M-1]
I know a way we can get paid
You can get down but you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get a ID
The name says you but the face is me
Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 let's make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And it's gonna be bout three weeks of waitin'
For American Express, Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Master Card
Cause, when we was boostin' shit we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say charge it
To the game we rockin' brand names
Well known at department store chains
Even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po Po never know who to true blame
Store after store you know we kept rollin'
Wait two weeks report the card stolen
Repeat this cycle like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch
Comin' out the mall with the shoppin' bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yeah, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right that's how we paid the rent
[Bridge x2]
Got to get this paper
I'm down for the caper, we steady on the grind
It's a daily struggle, we all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
As long as there's, drugs to be sold
I ain't waitin' for the system to plug up these holes
I ain't slippin' through the cracks
So I'm at Portland, Oregon tryin' to slip you these raps
The first black in the suburbs
You'd think I had ecstasy, percocet, and plus syrup
The way the cops converged, they fucked up my swerve
The first young buck that I served
I thought back to the block
I never seen a cop when I was out there
They never came out there
And out there, I was slingin' crack to live
I'm only slingin' raps to your kids
I'm only trying to show you how black niggas live
But you don't want your little ones actin' like this
Lil' Amy told Becky, Becky told Jenny
And now they all know the skinny
Lil' Joey got his doo rag on
Driving down the street blastin' 2Pac's song (Thug Life baby)
But Billy like Snoop, got his blue rag on
Now before you know it, you back in 'Nam
Now the police, got me in the middle of the street
Trying to beat me blue, black and orange
I'm like hold up, who you smacking on
I'm only trying to eat what you snacking on

Hell yeah, y'all don't like that do you
Hell yeah, you fucked up the hood nigga right back to you
Hell yeah, you know we tired of starvin' my nigga

I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out, uhh - bust it

[Big L]
Aiyyo I just left the studio, and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And there's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jump in the Jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep; my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
[Corle']
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn""

[Big L]
""It's my wife, you sure?""

[Corle']
""Yeah, I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door""

[Big L]
""Say no more, which one?""

[Corle']
""The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge""

[Big L]
""We goin' hurt those hoes""

[Corle']
""And hurt both of them kids""

[Big L]
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
""Yo, who that in the background?""
[Tommy Gibbs]
""It's Tommy Gibbs""

[Big L]
""Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, there's no time to back out

[Corle']
We gon' take the back route
And pull the gats out and throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone

[Big L]
We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do""

[Corle']
""So let's do it!""

[Big L]
I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?"" She paused and said ""212""
I took the steps now I'm out of breath; I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the Glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
[Corle']
These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate

[Big L]
We know they got stacks
Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose

[Corle']
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
""You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at""

[Big L]
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass, and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the T
I put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks

[Corle']
""Aiyyo fuck it L, we might as well pop these cunts""

[Big L]
Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money three ways

I'm the coolest shit especially when I'm throwing on my Gretzky
Got my S-S-Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti or Pirelli, make a movie out the ghettie
Wear my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while I'm stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl out a lezzie
Magazine, Mac, Desi, keep my windows like the Prezzie
Press a button and I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200-something and my trunk do wonders bumping
I am not the one for chumping, I will ratchet out and slump him
Dump him (dump him) he better off dead, your money red
[Interlude: Juelz Santana, Lloyd Banks]

[Juelz] I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high (always high)
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by

I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley I be moving, I be moving
Making movies, Tom Cruising, if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, neck studded, boy my nickname should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we about to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar, I call her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting, got a white girl that be poofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she's stupid
And she always ready to give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, ordered bottles, see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch looking like the 4th of July
But if you pussies get to fronting and the pushing lead to shoving
We just busting and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louis then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - your scheming don't affect me

I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
In that black-on-black thing whenever I ride by

I don't handcuff, you can bring the whole damn crew

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Kima's friends with Wendy
And both of these bitches want my penis, evidently
My jeans are never empty -- it seems, coincidentally
They say that time is money, so my team be spending centuries
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- life's full of decisions
If hating was a crime, you would do life up in a prison
The spiteful competition knows that they wouldn't have a shot at eating
Even if they had a rifle in they kitchen
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- Banks, 'elz, or Loso
We be paper touching -- bank teller flows, ho
Yeah, we smoke a lot of kush, drink hella rose Mo'
Y'all got a disease called ""Can't tell the ho's no""

And we hold heat like a motherfucking oven

I don't think they like me and I don't like em neither
But if they move wrong, I'll red up their white beater
I do it for the hood, I do it like no equal
I do it for the red, black, yellow, white people

And I don't play with grown men: I don't like to play

I'll murk your boy in March, they didn't find that boy til June

Yo, everything ain't love love, cause if it is
My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif' and his
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-leges
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny little nigga like Eddie Griffin is
Between smoking and joking then you got to live
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
You 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, fifteen years!
And now when we say ""what's up"" the shit seem weird?
But there's a question I prepared for you
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?
A thug changes

[Verse 2]
There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies
And whenever you cross it you make frenemies
There's no remedies for these sick memories
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emilys
Had a crush on you, now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more, it's no biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G--okay, silly me
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street
Really she attract niggas like the ""A Milli"" beat
And I happen to rap but something about this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change
Never thought she change
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes

I miss the cool nights sittin' in the Carlo
Now it's like ""boooo""--we sitting in Apollo
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo
And that's bad--matter of fact, that's sad
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give your a man a divorce
End up watching friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross

You're my bitch now, shut up and don't make no sound
Pretend this studio's a cypher
And do what you usually do - just stand around

She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

If you're single, put your hands up

Born 2 Kill,rap,M.O.P.,1996,1367,{},"Represent, show niggas the deal
I'm packing my blue steel, keeping it real
Cause niggas were born to kill

[Lil Fame]
Here comes the Brownsville slugger, motherfucker
I bust off shots at fools
To avoid these obstacles
I roll deep, me and my nigga Llama
With about seven niggas thats up in the clip to bring the drama
Homicide, take a ride in the hearse
Enemies out to hit me, but I'mma see em first
I'm ready, steady, and deadly but yet nervous
Let my burner serve its purpose and remove him off the surface
Gunshots let off! My instincts was to get him
Make sure I hit him, then break North, shonuff!
Holding down my fort, taking no shorts of no sorts
My four five turn to a blowtorch
It's still cocked! I tried to get away safe
Yo that shit was hot as hell I still stuck it in my waist
Dud my dirt, YEAH, did murk, YEAH, murder was the case
Then it hit heart beating like a nigga on base
I found a spot, chilled, parlayed for a second
Fixed my weapon, then headed back to my section
Now I'm back home smoking and drinking I'm bent now
I meditate on flashbacks of how it went down
It's kill or be killed, thats a true fact
There ain't no telling when these niggas are coming to bust open your back
It's ill, it's real, but still I feel
If provoked murder, nigga I'm born to kill

Yo, it's the case of the state
Versus the great one seven one eight
Gun slinger from Brownsville
Where niggas were born to kill

Yo, some chick think she saw you jump up out the jeep
You said you was across the street laying with the heat

[Billy Danze]
What? That bitch lying
Here's a cocksucker I never heard of
I ain't doing time for no motherfucking murder
When Mr. Gonzalez was stretched in the mud
I was home with the dog dome taking down what's up
Therefore I'm innocent!

[LaShonda]
Mad shells were spit

[Billy Danze]
They ain't mine
I do damage with an Imp, they found shells from a nine
This shit is crazy
Would you please contact Lazy
Tell him I need an attorney
To ride with me on this motherfucking journey
Now, ten months later, after being indicted
Third off of fifteen are clickin' shit so fuck it I'mma fight it
Me and the Jewboy lay back after D.A. spoke
Cross examination, Bernstein jumped up and broke no joke
Stepped over the judge's crown
Stepped on the D.A.'s ground
Looked at the snitch with a frown
Went to the jury and got down
Seventy-two hours later, creeping on some playing the wall shit
Toting the same Glock Mr. Gonzalez got knocked off with

Uh, uh-huh, yeah

Goodfellas, uh

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah, livin' the raw deal
Three course meals: spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros over in Rio de Janeir-y
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimmin' in women with they own condominiums
Five plus five's, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
In somethin' European chromed out with the clutch, what
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I wanna hold figures, fuck bein' a broke nigga
Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers (uh)
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers (c'mon)
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles (hahaha)
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme (that's right)
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you (uh-uh), 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picassos
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (wooo!)
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota (uh)
Avoidin' NARCs with camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the building with this chick named Wilona (uh-huh)
From Daytona, when I was young, I wanted to bone her (uh-huh)
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants (hahahaha)
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, ugh (c'mon)
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown (wooo!)
Pinky-ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'
To my bizzalls, player, you mad false
Actin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's

And you know me from makin' niggas so sick
Floss in my 6, with the 'lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it (Uh-huh)
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deep throat it (Come on)
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines
Get your own shit, why you ridin' mine? (Uh-huh)

Only female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do (Uh-uh)
Pull the trigger too, fuck you! (Uh)

I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole (uhh), undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (Uh-huh)
My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that whole life, we push weight (Uh-huh)
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes in Penn State (C'mon)
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
Playa haters, get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benjis, what?

Runnin Dying to Live,rap,2Pac,2003,552578,"{""The Notorious B.I.G.""}","[Intro: Rob Marriott & 2Pac]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's gon’—who’s gon’— who rules the nigga kingdom and shit, basically, you know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking
It is that
Election. It’s an election and shit
It is that
You know what I am saying?
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that. Me and Biggie’s situation is like…

[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know?)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police
[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that",367,en,en,en

When I release you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out .44s and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz

Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two

Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin' something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system

What part the game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin' lovely, with yo' spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryna break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue Six Coupé
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out
The block for distances, givin' long kisses, bitch
[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Only I can do now, I say a prayer for you
You know, that’s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see your mind is in control of your heart
Where it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cruel, you have made me cold

Got the new Hummer in the summer when
I was a newcomer then, drugs and MAC-10s

Be broke, girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke your ass out 'til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too

And God-forbid I cross that line

Making a Name for Ourselves,rap,Common,1997,19392,{Canibus},"[Intro: Canibus]
Yeah, yeah, me and my man Common Sense

Where you at, yo?

I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""

[Verse 1: Common]
Yo, yo
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect the rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
[Verse 2: Canibus]
I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me
Stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils of pterodactyls
Who wanna battle? I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's who compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What!?

[Scratching]
""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""

[Verse 3: Common]
I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with, accents you flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced
Than a rapper whose career you could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble, it's mistaken as a weakness
When poetry's in motion, like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
[Scratching]
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Yo, sick with it""

[Verse 4: Canibus]
Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all-seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal is given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wicked as Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this, new lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snaps, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear, black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into 'The Artist Formerly Known As'
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source, chilling on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM: www-dot-Canibus-dot-com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
A Beast from the East Pt. II, coming to see you
[Hook: Common and Canibus]
It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""
Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""

We Dont Care,rap,Kanye West,2004,519073,{},"[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's—

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown
[Chorus: Kanye West with Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

Feel a thousand deaths when I drop you

Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour, yeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]

So she call me cabron, plus maricon
Said she likes to cook rice, so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this Black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
Ma cherie amour, tu es belle
Merci, you're fine as fuck, but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian, and Black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn, I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crêpes
An appetite for destruction, but I scrape the plate, I love

I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love

A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out (What you doin', daddy?)
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed-head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl, wanna leave me, but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""

Check, Check, Check
Check it out, hip hop iz, all about biz
They tell you, but know that its all for the kids
Or deep down, it's all for the folks you miss
So you thinkin about it next time you poppin' a thizz
Criticize me for the way that I live, give a fuck
Cuz you turned to burn the bridge
You gave birth to a prince ever since you left me
Alone in the game on my own to MC
I'm runnin em' down, its something like a hunted child
A hundred thou to flip, if you underground
It gets deeper, the reefer rolled, control mics
But hey, the speakers blown
I gotta go, no time to play me
Gimme the blunt I hit hard like safetys
Face defeat, to me man I'm in the place to be
Do it live while Nick Peace remake the beat, like

Hip hop
This is hip hop (hip hop)
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Hip hop is now in performance
Hip hop (this is hip hop)
Hip hop is now in performance

Check, hip hop iz a gigantic market
Control your fan base and know who to target
Doin it worldwide but I ain't no star yet
I'm in the record store still tryin to bargain
Played the game starving, but pay my rhyme (pay my rhyme)
Buy the CD's I don't fuck with consignment
To all of you rap cats that's tryin to get major
Get ya paper pray, for a savior
Keep networkin, and contact your lawyer
Live your life like a warrior
Go back down man, you still got a question to answer
It's the industry and everythings gangsta
The gun smoking, they cutthroatin
They gone, choke bud and get no promotion
It's cold, catch emotion like hoes on periods
Experience the game and you take it serious
This is hip hop

(Chorus) (Scratched)

(Equipto)
Hip hop iz, multiple tricks
Pay a grip jus to get they ass all in the mix
Get frisked at the door, when we takin a risk
Shoot a swish, insist that I eat some Peruvian fish
Which is my favorite dish
And without no drama I blow the swish
Boy I ball up my fists and I feel the 'drenaline
I, never forget like a elephant
Still will drop the raw elements
Reppin' the west coast
Hit the club, fake love, fuck a dress code
Ignore the groupie hoes, cut the movie roles
That wasn't me I was probably in the studio
Somethin like a scientist, watch me strategize
My +midnight machine gun rhymes and alibis+
Treat it like nothing and continue to diss
But I be doin what I really feel hip hop iz
That's this

None of y'all better come get me

A million and one questions bloom
Who the fuck is Joell Ortiz? Then I looked up, then boom!
I'm mister fresh air, the savior, the golden child
The new crack with the soul of the oldest vial
What you think I got this movement in motion for?
I'm hot, like sand furthest from the ocean shore
You can search long and hard -- ain't no vocal flaws
Every one of my punchlines give you a broken jaw
Well, I hold it more; I'm supposed to score
And you're supposed to sit on the bench like your toes is sore
I'm a product of the stuff that I was raised around
Rocked over this cause it's my project's favorite sound
Boom! At night, they have fun with the lead
Same shots that woke me probably put someone to bed
I'mma come clean -- it's sad, probably something was said
Just to get a rep, and now another brother is dead

Hey yo listen here shortcake Camay glow
You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the chips got low
Because Tony can't be out there pushing that blow
We made plans and dreams, not grands and schemes
I want to search for the meaning of love, see what it means
Because we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soulmates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in the heart, hugs and kisses

We go together like Martin and Gina
But she get uptight want to fight like Ike and Tina
So love her or leave her alone like I don't need her though
A minute later I'm back like “I ain't mean it yo”
We break up just to make up
She fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A+
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You only cool when I'm digging your back

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV

One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine

Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end

All I need in this life of sin

While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend

Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind

(""I can feel it!"")

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Tonight's the night I get in some shit (Yeah)
Deep cover, on the incognito tip
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to, peelin' caps, too
Let your niggas know I'm comin' at you
I guess that's part of the game
But I feel for the nigga who think he just gonna come and change things with the swiftness
So get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission, and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxin' at the top
I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop
Kingpin, kickin' back while his workers slang his rocks
Comin' up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big, fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
'Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck, 'cause I'm goin' deep cover
[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call him ""Snoop Eastwood""
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace, and
The motherfuckin' punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre! (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feelin'
Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'
Killin', feelin' no remorse, yeah
So let's go straight to the motherfuckin' source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time
And now, they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock (So, what's up, nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfuckin' twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!

Six-four-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie bailed in the parkin' lot
The scene looked strange, and it felt like a setup
Bet' not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up!
Oh, here they come from the back in they 'Lacs
I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so what's up, black?
Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gon' come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip
'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?)
""We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh, yeah, but you got to sell dope for us""
""Hmmm, let me think about it""
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him 'fore I shot it?
If you don't quit, yeah
If you don't stop, yeah
I'm lettin' my gat pop

Hold up, I wanna rock right now
My name is Hov and I came to shake the town
Yeah, your boy's internationally known
But I'm from the hood, got a pocket full of stones
I used to cop ""Rob Base"", turn it into ""EZ Rock""
Just to stay ""Doug E. Fresh"", all that shit to easy rock
Used to ""Chef"" Raekwon, give fiends a ""Ghostface""
Y'all know my ""Forte"", I just might catch a dope case

With connects in the Midwest, so I'm ""Heavy"" in the ""D""
Your boy still ""Snoop"" around
Since a pup, I been ""Kurupt"" and I fuck with Tha Dogg Pound

Some dope lyrics is the only thing I slang now

It's no ""Biggie"" - heh, I'm just a king now

(*Malice N Wonderland!)

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I dropped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map
Like this like that while you rollin a bag
Loadin ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin ya back
I'm like the Whopper FUCK THE BIG MAC!!!
Run up on the dog my gat go click clack
And that's fo' sho!!!
The reason why, man I don't know so let's go cuz

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
Supreme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider, then they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man, I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but, son, I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 3]
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin

So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first-class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry, uh
Can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

Talkin' shit for shock value, boy, you ain't real
Turned hard the day Dre gave you a record deal
Went and sold your soul for some mass appeal
Servin' up that hors d'oeuvre, kid, now eat this meal
Instead of worryin' 'bout who you should be dissin'
You need to worry 'bout who your wifey been kissin'
Or if you go to prison while you're doin' your bid
I'll look in on your old lady and do things for your kid
Make her write you lots of letters 'bout the things that we did
Send you pictures of me chillin' all up in your crib
And that shit about Sway n' Tech? That was a fib
First time you met me I showed you love in D.C
But you were scared like a pussy with your eyes on the floor
While your crew showed me love outside the front door
Talkin' 'bout ""Yo, whassup, ain't you Whitey Ford?
I love that song 'What It's Like' and jam 'Praise the Lord'""
I don't do this for the money, yo, I do it for fun
You may hang around some gangstas, but you ain't one
And you won't be slappin' me with no empty gun
Talkin' 'bout a fag, but you the one in drag
And you can't keep your woman from goin' astray
Better run and check your kid for your DNA

For the ladies
One hundred and ninety-five pounds of beef
Chinky eyes, curly hair and gold teeth
Swinging with this here stud, you'll need practice
I'm leaving floods of blood on your mattress
I'll leave you holding your swollen backside and rolling
Filling all three holes just like bowling
Don't ask me what the price is
But it's more than your battery-operated devices
And I come fully equipped
With a temperature adjustment to heat up the tip
For demonstrations, watch me slam her
You'll notice the sound of steady pounding like a jackhammer
Once on it, you can't cop out
I'm pounding you down until your eyeballs pop out
I'm not your ordinary player
Because you'll leave in a wheelchair dear, after I lay ya
Get a grip on your headboard and hold on to it
Or get sent right through it

You still got a pussy like Isaac Hayes' head
Come back in five years
When you grow some hairs
And when ya started drinking beers
I'm hitting hookers by the dozen
Making you wetter 'cause I fuck better than your husband
Giving your girl back spasms
'Cause G Rap has 'em orgasm after orgasm
Change the sheets? You must be kidding
You got to change the whole box spring, I ain't bullshitting
You get hit with hysteria
'Cause I'm a bury a big one inside your private area

Let me explain to you exactly what I'm doing
Exploring your body like a biologist
Inventing new ways just like a scientist
Tagging my name on your buns just like a printist
While I'm hurting your ass just like a dentist
You're so wild, I feel like I'm a zoologist
Stretching your shit more than a gynecologist

And when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist

Freaking horny
Far from corny

Big girls try to squash me
But I think with my dick honey, so come and brainwash me
Hit the sack 'cause I ain't joking
'Cause when I start pumping shit up, I leave it smoking
So you better hold on tight, all right
'Cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite
I stick a chick and it kills her
I'm probably related to Long Dong Silver
But it gets gooder and gooder
Every time I grab a hooker and I put her on my frankfurter
Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip
'Cause the only thing I'm licking is your ass with a whip
And it's a real freaky scene
I'm hitting girls with their heads in a guillotine
Why, certainly I'm squirting
I bust a nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain
Pushing your head to the pillow
And giving more pleasure than a double-headed dildo
A big ass gets me hardened
But I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton
Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweetie
I'll fuck you on the ""A"" train while I write graffiti
In a restaurant, taking you straight to heaven
In a cab or the back of 7-11
Whether you're white and the music you like is rock
You can come and get some hip-hop cock
Consider this dick on your clitoris but never try to flex

Listen, hon, I mean, ah, as slamming as you are and all that good stuff, it ain't doing me no good out here because...
You have too many clothes on
So why don't we just take this cab and uh, slide on uptown and uh, slip outta all of this uncomfortableness of the world around us
Do you know what, you know what I am saying babes?
Matter of fact, uhhhhh...

Ah, honey listen here please
If sexy were a virus
Then you'd have a disease
Slamming is your styling
Let me speak for a while and
Tell you all about the grand slamming
(Why you smiling?)
Let's do the uptown slide
Don't need a transfer or auto ride
We only need a cab with us inside
Finally finally we got uptown
And when we got uptown
Honey's drawers came down
Did the audio visual
She had the residuals
Bah bah Dres, now tell me have U.N.E. Pull
I said honey, uhhh, again I said it slow
Coming out the boxers and my joint will surely grow
Then she started feeling
Yes, it was appealing
I thought of slamming girlfriend from the floor to the ceiling
We started five play
She said that she would come
I said it wasn't four play
Because I used my thumb
Nibbled on her neck
Oh, what the heck

Everything was Dolby, or rather all's OK
She was playing Frito and I play the Lay
Then I heard a knock only to hear a voice say...
[Mista Lawnge]
Yo, you can't have a show without the DJ
I entered in my drawers
To show that I was live
The ho didn't believe that I was nine point five
She said, 'Let me see it Lawnge, may I see it please?'
I said, 'Yeah, get a good look. Drop to your knees.'
I was erectified. I gave her the proof
And then I suggested a little woof woof
She was uptight, I said, 'Hon, there's nothing wrong
I'm the sugar dick daddy Mista Lawnge
Don't get offended by the position I recommended
Doggy style is my shit
The bottom is what I hit""
I didn't eat her
Or Rita, just beat her
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
Uhhhhhhh!
[Verse Three: Q-Tip]
Tip and Sugar Dick, blazing trails of evil
Lawnge, you got the felts 'cause I sure 'nough got the needle
Now put them on the arm that protrudes like a stick
And live up to your label Mista Lawnge Sugar Dick
As the dookie hits the fan, in comes the horny man
To finish up the task, so I'm scopin' out that ass
Lawnge, she wants it
Her hands spreads the butt cheeks
Tip plus Lawnge plus the ho equals wet sheets

God damn
Yo, somebody give me
A horny time
Somebody give me a hole
Spread the ass
Just give me a hole
No man
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm coming, in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face

Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

In December, drinking horchata

With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada

Oh, you had it but oh, no, you lost it
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it

Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Are falling down and nearing the rosebeds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

You bad gambling nigga
Niggas moving fast gotta pump the brakes on 'em
They better pump 'em fast before I beat the brakes off 'em

And you's a real phony looking like a big steak

Hit you in your left eye, now you can't see shit straight
Ray Charles niggas blind to the fact --
While you was in your class, I was grinding getting scratch
The night grind and you get scratched

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet, defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets, and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?!
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
[Verse 7: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid

[Verse 8: 2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted

Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
'Cause I don't like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, BOW! What up, homie?
Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me

[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracs
They keep 'em on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah!)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo!)

I'm not a marksman while sparking, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear ""He say, she say"" shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blat!)
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear your block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""

These cats always escape reality when they rhyme (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah!)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa (Hahaha)
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo!)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that could kill you in eight bars
50, um... Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends

Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?

So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm
The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy, I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus
My soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woma just to keep my lyrics comin'
(Bitch!) We elevated to new heights, premeditated
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
Now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick, all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it
And actin' like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's rock the bells and you's a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep comin' like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got somethin' for your ass to hate
I blast your hate and have you all runnin' past the gates
And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance? No, we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills and act like you know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
You don't know shit so when you see one, flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory
It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty (Ha)
If he's actin' soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner than Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours, let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack

Oh, yes, I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description? Her body's sickening
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing: I can be her religion
And now, she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed—must be the weather
I dress her: I am her sleeves, I am her feathers
She's fly—flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her; she loves me, too; I love her three times
More than her mom; time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should—we should be wherever she wanna be on a
Late night, midday, A.M., just say when
And I know I be with cavemen, but never mind them
She's ""Poison,"" and I am Michael Bivins

What grown folk do when they had too much to drink, and I think

I see you at the altar, Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter, or son—more than one
Maybe five, like the Jacksons, or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And Daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman's soap and shampoo
And lotion and perfume and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes
I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever—wow!
Leave her to me, and she'll be smiling every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated; panties are debated

Licking it like an envelope; mailing it, sealing it, read it

Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby

Face down, ass up

Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two

Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV

And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)

Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right?
Heh, watch this!
Hey, Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars!
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride!
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and Quik finna show you niggas
What it's like on this side—the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you don't fuck with, 'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches
[Verse 1]
9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free?
I proceed to make 'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere: ""Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit"" that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men

[Chorus: Richard Pryor & 2Pac]
""No heart for the fightin'""
""I was in every gang, they had about five, I was in all of 'em
Whichever one was winning, 'That's my side'""
The hearts of men
""Cause I wasn't fightin' shit
Nigga made me unball my fists once, show you how scared I was
I had my fists up, ready, he said, 'Muthafucka, put your hands down!'""
[Verse 2]
My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G in this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men

[Chorus]
In the hearts of men

[Verse 3]
To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again

It's Mr. ""Throw It In The Bag"", I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I ain't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front, I'm a buy her what she want
Cause your queen 'posed to get what she desire, what she want
If my lady like to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch, she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green, she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want, bet it's gon' cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do

Honestly she's probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If her card declined, you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah, just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband 'til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's her baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in '86
Yeah, she say she lucky that she his

Three in the morning when I come for ya
Tell your baby mother to take cover under the comforter
Leave her a widow, your mother have to comfort her
When them big uncomfortable guns are dumping, sir
Blood on my sleeve - my first line, ""Time to leave""
Blood on my watch cause it was your time to bleed
When the beef's right, pick a fresh nine to squeeze
Raise the heat to a hundred and ninety nine degrees
You dudes too minor league
Me, I'm behind the trees
Blending in, something like fatigues
Jump out like John Rambo, armed with ammo
I'm a commando, stay in [Com's mandos?]
Squat low when them blammers spit
In the craziness, I might blast a bitch
I'm no atheist, I'm not blasphemous
Pray to God forgive me, they try to blast and miss
I know God was with me, but am I hustling backwards
Or is it drama is just in love with us rappers?
I want a better role like struggling actors
I'd rather chill like I'm on muscle relaxers
With a couple of masterpiece chicks to guzzle my bastard seeds quick
That would be sick
Instead, I'm a warrior at war
Saying an American prayer like I'm Jim Morrison in the Doors
Praying I survive, paranoid as I'm looking out the window
Nigga, I shoot before the wind blow
Kinfolk, please don't ignore this info:
Niggas get bagged and smoked more than indo
Who I trust? Me
Save that ""we"" shit for Nintendo
Before morbid pistols
Blow you out this orbit
Forfeit, get low
Or get buried under horseshit, big bro
Yeah, I stay blasting pipes
'Til I see my favorite rappers in the afterlife
I been kidnapped like Kanye in ""Flashing Lights""
Held against my will, it didn't last a night
I made it out in one piece
Now I keep at least one piece
Just add water, you niggas made a young beast
Unleash Jekyl and Hyde, the rebel arise
Several have died, so what's beef?
Beef is when your captors are after you
For doing what you have to do
Killing the other half of their faggot crew
And it's true
The color of my heart is the blackest hue
Understand this madness, sadness
If I wasn't rapping, I'd be strapped to a mattress
Eating a Prozac sandwich -- goddamn, this is therapeutic
Since it's the bomb, it's thermobaric music
Stashbox weapons of murder occupy
More firearms than burning octopi
That's why they call 'em ""burners"", I just taught you why
Get equipped, cause you slow learners got to die
If you coming for me, best believe I'm disabling you
Let Death set a table for two
If you coming for me, best believe I'm disabling you
So let Death set a table for two

In the race for the West Coast, I'm leading right now

My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot

Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot

'Cause these motherfuckers love to see you gone
You gotta stay strong, young brother, 'cause it's on
And I'll be slangin' these thangs till the break of dawn
Gotta make my ends, then it's time to take it home
I got some hoochies on my pager, it's major
Let me play her like a game of fuckin'  SEGA

No love for these bitches 'cause when you down and out, they backs turn
Now dig em and ditch em, be about my riches, sip my liquor and let my sack burn
Can't let these funky cock hoes destroy me
Only quality time I'm spending is on these blocks that employ me
These punk-ass cops annoy me, playa hatin' on my cash got

Tryin' to crash my spot, tryin' to stop a nigga from earnin' stacks

Stop Being Blinded,rap,Esau,2011,72,{​wizard},"Da Wizard

I believe that the creators of the news hire crews
To batter and abuse all the clues and keep us all confused
And leary of leaving your home
For the fear of the unknown
And now they got you in a zone
Believing only what they've shown
Until your mind is blown from the badness
Sadness, madness, very little gladness
Until you buy protection from your fears
But how do you kill a fear
They've got you where they want you
In a life that's plus and minus
You might as well use your anchor man as a security blanket
And change your name to Linus
It's easy to control the metropolis
With the amount of negativity that's fed to the populace
But you 've got to keep it clear
Too much can cause rebellion
But the right amount can cause fear
Enough to cause lack of trust
Enough to cause hatred and disgust
Enough to make you lust
Enough to make a little kid grab the gun an bust
Enough to make you leave your lover in the dust
Enough to make you cuss
And if it wasn't bad enough to handle
They hit you with the 24 hour a day newschannels
Trying to keep us all in grief with no relief
They got you gritting your teeth and waiting for someone to beef
They giving you the foul run of it, flaky government
Here is the news, they need to put the word bad in front of it
You think that's ill, check me
The news is a criminal's blueprint on doing crime correctly
And good deeds go unheard of
But you hear about crime, the bad politics and of murder
And it's hard to read into the subjects that they lead into
They bleeding you with this illness they feeding you
Until you get full, from what you thought was a brand new cow
But it was the same old bull
Stop being blinded
Stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit
We don't have to be reminded
Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it

Stop being blinded
Stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit
We don't have to be reminded
Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it

Esau

I'm not too happy with all this shit I see on TV
It's gotten to me and all I do is stay confined to my misery
Locked away looking at ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC
Kosovo depressed me, China scares me
Y2K is coming to get me
And all I see when I turn on my local news TV is the newest remedy
For me to cure my case of my HIV
Or Syphyllis or Herpes, because 20% of Americans have it
So you know that means me
I look at the world pesimistically
And I discovered it looks the same right back at me
The world is out to get me
Salesmen try to jerk me, drunk drivers aiming their cars at me
And high school nerds are trying to hurt me
I don't eat beef, because the government laces it chemically
But I can admit I'm addicted to chicken
The steroid-enhanced original white meat
An Arab killed an Israli, an Indian a Pakistani
A cop killed a homeless lady in Cincinnati
Is it just me or is the world really that crazy
That  I can't even go to the mall
To get myself a  pair of new Nikes
Cause someone might rob me on my way out of Starbuck's coffee
Here you go man it's just a latte and my money
I'll I got is a buck-thirty
But you know they'll take it all according to TV
And it's negativity
Last night on TV I saw death and disease
I saw rape and conspiracy
I saw shit I hoped would never happen to me
I saw kids with no feet and kids with no teeth living poverty
And complete misery.  I also saw a new high on Wall Street
More money made today than ever in history
But none was giving to me or those kids that preceded
Fuck the media and be wary of your local news stories on TV
Stop being blinded
Stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit
We don't have to be reminded
Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it

Stop being blinded
Stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit
We don't have to be reminded
Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it",19027,en,en,en

London, England, South of France
And all points between, they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap' or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like ""Oui""
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' a model standin' 'bout 5'8""
5'9"", fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland tryna buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the Four Seasons off the heezy

A couple fiancés, I'm the new DeVante
Come and talk to me mami in the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope she ain't too young (Woo)
Only twenty-one and older, let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryna show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep one place, tell the pilot keep the engine
Runnin' then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind, crippled and crazy

Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie, I know
Shit, it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough and if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you

Soundtrack 2 My Life,rap,Kid Cudi,2009,873924,{},"[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 3]
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie
[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

Come gangsta
Throw your rags in the air
And know that nobody there
Will compare to your gangsta
Sag your pants to the floor
Every woman's a bitch or a whore
When you're gangsta
Pack ya guns in the club
If they shrug give them thugs mean mugs
Yeah come gangsta
Is what they sayin' to me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I've been nice to you rapper cats for a long time
I left Kansas City so them other cats can go and shine
But it seems these punks are confused because I'm my own kind
But I'm back on deck 'cause Kansas City is whose throne? Mine!
This ain't no punk shit
Nigga this is strength at its finest
I made this shit so you all you simps can rewind it
Meaning you pussies who say this Tech shit ain't hard for real
And try to disregard the real
You motherfuckers is hard to feel
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
But I stay ahead of the game
And you punks is so late
'Cause my one gangsta track will demolish your whole tape
I've been with every rapper who's legendary
Underground to mainstream know that Tech is very hard
'Cause I bring the heater
Love me 'cause I'm your leader
Bitches, they suck my Peter
While I'm drinkin' Margaritas
Niggas get layed down
Seven displayed sounds
N9ne, the crazed clown
Lines like sprayed rounds
This is for all you haters who don't pump my shit
If you say this ain't gangsta you can suck my dick!
[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
I might look like a clown, huh
But you niggas sound like a muthafuckin' circus
Fuck you muthafuckas

[Outro: Yukmouth]
This nigga is the tightest nigga movin' man
I mean... Tech N9ne will demolish all you niggas
From the stage show to rockin' the mic, you name it
That's why I roll with him

Queens Gambit,rap,DJ Muggs & GZA The Genius,2005,6521,{},"[Verse: GZA]
She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETS
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially BEARS
Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers
A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS
Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled
Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, cause she was behind them BILLS
Had a man who always roared like LION
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying
Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""ten-i-see"", you just need to TITAN your game
Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS
The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners
They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
Great for a script, but out of bounds for a musical
She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR
Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a RAVEN
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her
There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS
Militant as PANTHERS, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the CHARGER
I introduced myself to gain yardage
Cuz anything less then smooth, would've been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS
She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would've been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line
Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet
And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS
But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a COLT, before I released them puddles
They spread EAGLES like wide receivers
As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers
[Outro: movie sample]
I be liking chess
Cuz chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess
The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement
You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy
Planning, music, it's hip-hop, and sports
It's life, it's reality",937,en,en,en

Run up on you with an army, it is on 'til it's done, finished

Y'all can keep it, they got flashlights now, and flamethrowers
And I got one on my back right now—""Remain focused""
That's what I tell myself now and then
Don't wanna go back to that block like where Varejao defends
Uh-oh, my stomach growls again
I ain't none of you cowards' friends
Every human out of my sight before I count to ten (Woo!)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
I'm hungry like I never ate (Rrrrrr)
Set a table up with knives, forks, and spoons
I'm 'bout to get a plate
All these weak dummies lookin' yummy like a pepper steak
Me and these streets'll never separate, we ain't married
Yeah, but every time I touch a pen, I sorta set a date
I'll devastate your career, look, I'ma demonstrate
Let me get a good breath I take before I regulate
Okay, bye-bye, you guys
Don't try to rhyme 'cause line for line, what I design is mine
And my point is: I'm divine and I'm right behind
The big guy that shines all the light in mine
So my eyes can find a nice dime to grind

You loud-talking wouldn't kill a thing
Matter of fact, where's your head, nigga? I got the guillotine
Fuck your Hollywood limousine and rented bling
I give you three red dots and I call it a triple-beam
I'll put your pad on your property, fag
Properly rob you and hop in the Jag
If you stopping the profit, the Glock'll be popping
Your body'll rock a colostomy bag

“I had a bad dream”
“Don’t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams”
“What a time you chose to be born in”

[Chorus: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year’s
And all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a TEC
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight
Fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Linx was snatched off necks, left scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel
Made ‘em fold and squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his farmers
And it’s bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everythin' except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his C.R.E.A.M he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don’t suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee, they hit the vertebrae
Increase the murder rate
Similar to hitmen who pull out TECs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington
[Chorus: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin', and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips, full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o’clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass, young bucks is learnin' fast
Three-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours
Bought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questionin' while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
‘Cause niggas’ main concern is C.R.E.A.M
Some niggas in the jet-black Galant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead, but instead, he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
‘Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I’m not an actor
But the author of a modern-day opera
Where the main character is presidential papers, the dominant factor

You know, you had me
With your sensuous charm
But you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by

Diamonds are forever (yeah)
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
Uh, F&F, yeah
You know what I'm saying
I figure, I feel like I should just
You know, show people other side that weren't aware
You know what I'm saying
They are presently unaware
They don't know about it
You know what I'm saying
You know just show 'em there's an other side to this thing right here
We call it bling

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah
Allow me to break down the game
Behind the bracelets, earrings, chains, watches and rings
The bling
The crystal encrusted, princess flooded
Canary studded, blue coloured and blood stained
Yeah, the older brother of the drug game
The giver of fame, the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child miner's pain
Long ago kings used to wear 'em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare 'em
If you wasn't rich, couldn't wear 'em
Witches used to marry 'em
They'll shoot you before they share 'em
The gift and the curse, the venom and the serum
Most hated lady's best friend, get murked for a clear one
[Bridge]
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
You know what I'm saying
(Diamonds are forever)
Now I ain't comin' down on nobody
You know what I'm saying
I ain't trying to judge nobody and nothin' like that (Forever)
You know what I'm saying
I floss too, I might go get me a pinky ring tomorrow
You know what I'm saying
But, I just want you to see man
You know what I'm saying
Just see man

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, Cecil Rhodes sowed war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself, ""Do they finance yours?""
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was Cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie, it's a wrap for the nonsense rhyming
Props to Kanye, I call it ""Conflict Diamonds""
[Outro]
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
You know what I'm saying
I felt like I should just let you all know that
You know what I'm saying
Make you all aware, so many people
Do things to glorify 'em
I felt like it was time for somebody to do somethin'
That would horrify 'em
You know what I'm saying
Bet you never thought that
That 20 karat ring or 20 karat chain or bracelet that you got on
Is fundin' some little war somewhere
Got some little kid murderin' a whole family somewhere
You know what I'm saying
But hey! Just think, now you know
You know what I'm saying
You gotta know to be a hypocrite, baby (haha!)

I'm tryna get rid of this weight, like K-Fed
Me and Denaun got a gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime thing to you, that ain't the prom
The next emcee that rhyme official, with ref, with a whistle
That ain't Young Money, I'ma definitely diss you
If you rhymin' ""packin' a MAC"" with ""back of the Acura""
Perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular

Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous, sawed the crazy part off his brain and he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?

And red M&Ms chartered from Charlotte

My clique is too sick, say goodbye
In the streets where the stakes is high, like Ruth's Chris

Where the mayor went to jail
For bein' a player right after Proof split
Levels the head of competitors, Royce that

In order to leave it alone, you have to ween me off
That Lorena Bobbitt chopper will knock a weenie off
Put your body between chalk
I'm squeezin' the 9 iron, like I'm swingin' golf
I'm with the best rapper alive, put somethin' on it
Your sound's plain as a cheeseburger with nothin' on it

[Interlude: Eminem]
Uh, yo

[Verse 9: Eminem]
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around while I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back, faggot, fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can, man you don't wanna open up that
Wait a min, ah, shit… Alchemist, cut that!

If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I took the time out, then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like a favor, I feel like a savior
They clocking my neck: I feel like I'm Flavor

What's up Fabo?
Aye man (oh...), I got that black AmEx with me
A.K.A. that ""Throw It In The Bag"" card
Radio Killa (Yeah)

Now I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?)
Just throw it in the bag (Neiman Marcus on me and all that?)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (Yeah, come on then)
Just throw it in the bag

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L, when I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say ""GET U 1""
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second

Baby Dont Go,rap,Fabolous,2007,57163,"{T-Pain,""Jermaine Dupri""}","[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {J.D.}]
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

[Fabolous]
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Bimmer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

Soon Youll Understand,rap,JAY-Z,2000,100557,{},"[Intro]
Mmm, you don't understand now because you're cryin', and you hurt
You'll understand soon enough
Soon enough

[Chorus]
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

[Verse 1]
You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit, I watched you mature, nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder, I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin' a guy
'Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, his pimp'll die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better, this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
(You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that, you know?)
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
If they found that you was huggin' me
My conscience is fuckin' with me

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you

Man, I look in the eyes of our..
This.. our kid this whole life we made together..
We're tryin', really tryin' to make it work
I'm young, and I ain't ready, and I told you

It ain't like, I ain't tell you from day one, I ain't shit
When it comes to relationships, I don't have the patience
Now it's too late, we got a little life together
And in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever
But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever
A different girl every night forever; told you to leave
But your stubborn and you love him and
No matter what, despite all the fuckin' and the cheatin'
You still won't leave him, now you're grievin'
And I feel bad, believe me
But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy
Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate
You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna fuss
You the mother of my baby
I don't want you to hate me, this is about us
Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be
And 'cause I love you, I want you to leave, please

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you

I mean, I seen you workin two or three jobs
Daddy left; I, I thought I was makin' things better
I made it worse

Dear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell
Writin' this scribe, thinkin' 'bout how you must feel inside
You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow
Goddamn, I ain't the young man that you used to know
You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like
Bling-bling ice; I was wrong in hindsight
Shit, we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out
But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules
I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews
And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs?
Co-workers saw me on the corner slingin' Larry Love
Meanwhile, you workin' hard, like 2 or 3 jobs
Tryin' to feed me and my siblings, makin' an honest livin'
Who am I kiddin'? I, call myself easin' the load
I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary
Try to understand, please

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you

Yo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na)
I dedicate this to you (Hahaha, yo)
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
'Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, 'cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, 'cause I get respect, I bet you (What?)
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew (C'mon)
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you (Aw)
Peckerwood mad 'cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, ""Heck, country-western rap records are good""
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (Haha)
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin' to hear some fucking old fart in a chair
Sittin' on stage, strummin' acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career?
I punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear (Bitch)
And fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'mma say they names so they can be famous too
[Hook 1: Eminem]
You just a quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I swear to God, I'mma kill you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke (Please)
And I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you? Bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin' mouth while you O-for-two
Back in '94, Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck 'cause now your music sucks dick
Mr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
But never last, and Everlast is a
[Hook 1: Eminem]
Quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I swear to God, I'mma kill you

A'ight, look (Listen)
So this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin'
Shit, in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin' tables in that bitch, cleanin' the toilets

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim, but you Irish White
So fuck you, fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus, I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin' while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MCs
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha!

They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still?
This ain't no freestyle battle, Everlast gettin' killed
With his chest open
Tryna throw a fuckin' punch, but you just chokin'
Having a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
'Cause you suck, motherfucker, you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' about you packin' pistols, but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail
Ha, Erik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious, you pro'bly was gay
Ha, now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine-thousand copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up, haha

[Verse 8: Proof & Eminem, Both]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave. where bullets tear you in half (Haha)
Fuck the music, we got a Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated, you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches, get your throats cut

[Verse 9: Swifty]
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fucking guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart

Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
'Cause we hit 'em up like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!
[Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)]
Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)

Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga
[Bridge: Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'fore they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be

Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said ""I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns (Pssss! Ow!)
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it
[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 2]
I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the ""Shady"" is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians (Uh)
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pens
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends
[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin

[Verse 3]
Last night, I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
""Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!""
""It's probably AIDS!"" ""Forget it then.""
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
""Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.""
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello?!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded

Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them K's
Heavy guns and dope funds and raids by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police
'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of your skin get you put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sending niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feeling like the Lord will never answer me back
So I'm holding on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in your house will make it hard to sleep
You see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
A lot of niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

I could never win an Oscar cause I don't know how to act
Saw my first million dollars and I ain't know how to act
Then the second million came, then more came after that
Then more came after that, hurricane after that
Damn! And y'all saw the aftermath
And in my hood we don't front, so I do give back
When you see a hood nigga you gotta tilt your hat
And since I'm a hood nigga, I do just that
OGs used to tell me: ""You just rap
Lil' nigga all you need to do is rap""
And just when I thought I was gon' do just that
Poppa was a Rolling Stone and them stones was crack
Fuck being like Mike I wanna be like pop
Then I picked up a mic I wanna be like 'Pac
Please put down the pipe you don't need that rock
Please put up a fight for the kids that watch
Us in the spotlight and then they mock
But caskets get closed and then they drop
And cases get closed and they are dropped

Always talk to God, never listen to cops

Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas with the last shit they ate in stomach
Spinach and steak. GORE-TEX boot prints still on his face
It's still on his face when we visit his wake
Whatever's undone I'd do it, fight against a whole army
One gun I'll use it, some Sun Tzu shit
Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia
You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversations with creeps with foul natures
Attempted murders trials, the basics
Threatening the witnesses and relatives of dead victims
It's the shit we live, uh
Queensbridge thug matrimony, clap a phony
Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie

Mom couldn't take me, the bitch still hates me

I'm proud to announce I'm probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called the law enforcement when I broke the lawn mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, ""Please fix me!""
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then's
When I decided to cut class to rap full time

Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B, Hayley Williams]
I could really use a wish right now (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Mmm-mm-mm-mm)
Like, like, like shooting stars (Ahh-ah-ah-ah)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
A wish, a wish right now",428,en,en,en

You see, my money like a baker's shop
That's why I make the powder blow
First I get ""papi"" bread, then I make sour dough
You still pump-a-nickel, move every hour: slow
My work so powerful. Your money ours, bro
Ain't no bagel jokes, but for butter I be raisin' toast
Like a bread truck I keep the latest loafs
I serve beef, grab pounds and squeeze
Get sick with the 40, call it ""Mad Cal Disease""
My niggas get down for cheese and felony raps
Ya'll niggas hamsters: really can't tell if they rats
But you call em turtles when the shell in they back
I play 8Ball from Menace, I can help you with that
Then I'm back to melt the track soon as the vanilla crack
2-door NSX: that's a selfish Ac'
Mack to your pelvis, black, I put you where Elvis sat
Walk in pawn shops when I take your chain and sell it back

Barbies watch the dealer. Admit it: I'm hard to top
Hater, I'm back. Face it: you're whack
JR is crack, the same thing they place in a pack
I stay in the trap
So, no, you won't hear ""808"" when I put some damn bass on a track
I bring the fiends out, give them niggas what they need
I don't see droughts, it is figures what I see
Bring them ki's out to the middle of the P's
No matter the temperature degree
Rain, sleet, snow, I'm pitching em for sheez
Peel bricks, you'll have to go to Switzerland for these

Heart of a Lion Kid Cudi Theme Music,rap,Kid Cudi,2009,196726,{},"[Verse 1]
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

[Chorus]
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
[Verse 2]
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream, I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact, my mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me

Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me

[Verse 3]
I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell

Coolest nigga, what? (Dumb it down!)
F-N-F, up! (Dumb it down!)
(Dumb it down!)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace
[Hook 1: Gemini]
You going over niggas heads, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They telling me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down!)
We ain't graduate from school, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Them big words ain't cool, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Yeah I heard ""Mean and Vicious,"" nigga (Dumb it down!)
Make a song for the bitches, nigga! (Dumb it down!)
We don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down!)
You'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down!)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, ""hot fiya"" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep?
[Hook 2: Graham Burris]
You've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)
You're makin 'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're gettin' self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)
These girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!

You putting me to sleep, nigga (Dumb it down!)
'S'why you ain't popping in the streets, nigga! (Dumb it down!)
You ain't winning no awards nigga! (Dumb it down!)

Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! (Oh)
We don't bullshit, better ask around

Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out (Come on)

And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
Yeah, I think I did too much (Huh-uh)
This substance equals cuffs (Huh-uh)

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk

I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?
No? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke

Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady

Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine

But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission

My first sack was a fifty pack, when I was only 13
Niggas idolizing ballers, disrepecting dope fiends
First string on the team, came home from practice
Had some drama with my mama, found my stash under my matress
Caught an ass whooping, all my privilages tooken
Niggas my age getting paid, and I ain't gon stand there just looking
See my uncle be cooking, he's an old school soldier
Use to send me to the corner store, back and forth for baking soda
One day this nigga came over, Texas plates with a briefacase
Didn't know back then, but he was bringing in the fucking weight
I told my uncle fuck a eight, I need a zone
Dropped a gallon the scale, and told me to get my ass on
No need for chaperone, got my grind on on my own
One roof stuck on my dome, stay away from school zones
See my paper got long, but I wasn't done yet
I graduated and migrated, from Bogalusa to Laffeyette

Reconstructed my plans, got down with some niggas from Lake Charles
Started thinking strategic, nigga how can I win
Fuck that front shit, got down on I-10
Nigga's stash spot all good, stuffing my cheese under my hood
Late night by the bail I'ma make the mail
Then think they tell, should of knew they would
Should of understood how it go, nigga see me bout to burn a row
Out here trying to earn the do', and all these niggas wanna turn a hoe
They told the FED's bout the cash, even told them hoes about the stash
Trying to mash on the gas, but that didn't last
I came back, thugs waiting on my ass
Got busted by the task, now I'm waiting for the time to pass
Can't wait to get out, so I could find that snitch
Grab my shit, and go blast his ass
Nigga fuck a mask I'll get the last laugh, when you in a hearse bitch
This is the tale, of how I got my first brick

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Now I'm back on the turf, third verse gets deeper
See it's pressing Nextel, said to hell to beppers
Street sweepers, calicoes, Columbians and them Mexicans
Everybody on they feet, but in the street they plexing
After sex from this bopper, use to fuck in 9-4
Told me that nigga got a Coupe, and gave me the scoop on his hoe
Told me they both like it go, to the club on Friday night
Caught him leaving Cornbread's, should of busted his head by the light
Grip my infrared tight, ready to bust teflons
I was itching to do him in, when he stopped by Exon
But that shit'll be dumb, even know where he live
Stayed five cars back, and followed his ass to his crib
Now I'm thinking of what he did, not three years ago
Reached under the seat, for the calico
And caught him, soon as he opened his do'
Now there's nowhere to go, put the barrell to his head
'Fore I left they ass for dead, Noke D this what I said
(*talking*)
Yeah bitch ass nigga, remember me
Give it up bitch (*gun shots*) (*screaming*)

Making this money man
Uh-huh, true that, true that
Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over there
On the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby

Still swangin' and bangin' ha, boys gon' feel us man
Boys gon feel us, wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what

See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swangin' on the feeder
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, squattin' like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
Get the cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rent cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine in my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

Now when I come down
I be throwing up the North showin' off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 boss
I floss the candy green gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young teen's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust out shots
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon' represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, froze by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy, huh

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse
Ha, we got the braids and fades, and ride 4's and blades
Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades
Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast
Hol up, that candy blue or that green, gon' keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene
In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU
Uh, and I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a Y-2G bird, valeted on the curb
See them boppers still boppin', them choppers still choppin'
Them tops still droppin', the trunk still poppin'

I'm not trying to be no big thing, no, no
You gotta let this one breathe, Just'
Just let it breathe for a second
I'm not trying to give you no advice
Yup! Hovi's home!
The newest addition to the Roc: M.O.P
I don't claim to be no philosopher
""The Blueprint 2"" is on its way
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming!
But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby
Let's go get 'em, Just'!

[Interlude: Lil' Fame & Bobby Byrd]
Time to dump (Fire!)
Dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!)
You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1: Lil Fame & Billy Danze]
It's the MO-P! (Yes!)
And the ZIP code is 1 (1!) 2 (3!) 3
And motherfucker, we coming, 100 miles and gunning (Owwww!)
I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of eggshell 80s and hatchback Saabs (Same game!)
Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go BLAKOW! Run up if you wanna
Believe me dog, these hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up, have you in blue Pampers, in a coma
And your family now mourn—look, seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up, with a hospital gown on
(We holding it down, homes!) Keep pushing, we fell bastards
To get over, we grind with slippery shell tactics
Chippety-frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' niglet, what the fuck you recording for? Nick Jr.?
(The game ain't changed!) It just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S-Dot Carter
Brownsville (Yep!) we stomp through this bitch all day (Oh)
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss said stage (Uh, uh, uh)
[Verse 2: Billy Danze, Billy Danze & Jay-Z]
I'm from the G side of things (Oh), where we ride and bang
With a heat that'll flame, that's how we got the name:
(Warriors!) Embedded in your brains
And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came
And we're better in the game, you better make it rain
(Twenty-seven a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and 'url
A decade on the grind (Uh) nigga, I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumbass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young ass kids (M.O.P.!)
The OGs repped and survived around this motherfucker
(FIRST Family!) We kept it live around this motherfucker (Oh!)
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay
Fo' shizzle, my nigga, learned to grip pistols in BK

Woooooo!
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

More fire, more Rocawear attire
More money, more murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
More further for the Roc empire, y'all won't serve us
Y'all nervous, know them guns on full service, ready to fire

Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law
Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors—""How About Some Hardcore?""
And it just get worser, every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephews situated, and my mama is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction, I am starving today
Got a money-hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste

The Lost Tribe of Shabazz,rap,Lakim Shabazz,1990,1138,{},"Our people will survive America

[Verse 1]
My people were took from the motherland
By the other man
Brought to the wilderness
Like a ventriloquist
Played my people like puppets by plantin' fear in their heart
Nowadays most of us don't know where to start
10% of us can help, but don't feel the need
They love greed
And this really bothers me
85% of us are totally ignorant
Walkin' around with the nigga mentality
5% of us are ready to die for the cause
Of course the source is Elijah
Knowledge of self is what you need to stop the bull
If you don't get it, I'm held responsible
Rhymes I make are designed to reach the youth
I gotta teach, that's why I speak the truth
Some waste time dwellin' on the past
It's time they know that we're the lost tribe of Shabazz
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America

[Verse 2]
Stay awake and don't sleep, 'cause I'm comin' after ya
Devils I smash and leave 'em flat as a spatula
Back again, the mathematical radical
Gettin' emotional, very emphatical
The original man uses 23 million square miles on the planet Earth
Constantly buildin'
On the other hand the other man wants to confuse ya
Simple psychology, tricknowlogy fools ya
They have you believe we descend from cannibals
Show you pictures of Africans lookin' like animals
How could we be animals, look at the things we did
With our own bare hands we built pyramids
Blind, deaf, and dumb is how they raised ya
To them it's Africa, to us it's Asia
To get to the point, to make it clear to ya
They're no superior, and we're not inferior
I got the other man pointin' at me, 'cause I licked him
Took a stand for the black man, and didn't fall victim
The nation is growin' rapid and fast
That's why I'm tellin' you we're the lost tribe of Shabazz

Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
[Verse 3]
I couldn't wait to battle a beat like this track
It's so def, I had to pump my fist, black
My rhymes weigh six sextillion tons
Heavy as the Earth, a lyrical function
Imagine if every black man, woman and child
Would simply refuse
To go to work for one day
Do you know how much money these companies would lose?
Since everything's based on money, that's what we gotta get
We gotta learn when to quit, when not to quit
It's really sad, I know some people
Think that one day we'll be treated as equal
It's the land of the freedom, or so they say so
They tell you're free, yeah, but free to do what though?
Off our arms and legs they took the chains
Big deal - they still left 'em around our brains
Things I say make the government fear this
I speak with authority, so you can hear this
I hate oreos, that's why I gots to bomb
You so-called niggerish Uncle Toms
We're on a rise-up, you better wise up
You can't stop us, now are you surprised, duck?
You might take it as a political outblast
But we're the lost Tribe of Shabazz
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America
Our people will survive America",27485,en,en,en

A little jux or something

Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money-money-money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money-money-money

You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your mama in the living room now hog-tied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand-new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dreads serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please
This the stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah, nigga, YEAH!

Who's that peeping in my window?
Wow—the Feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming, ""Fuck Jake!""
I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA—now, that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take, the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key
[Chorus]
Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly

Treat Her Like a Prostitute,rap,Slick Rick,1988,30487,{},"[Intro]
Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it

[Verse 1]
Excuse me (what?) Can I have your attention? (mhm-hmm)
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (mhm-hmm)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you, as Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same

[Hook]
Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

[Verse 1]
Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid, ""It's not your child""
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him
[Hook]
Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

[Verse 2]
Now your wife, you buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you ""The bitch don't deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out, bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself ""She might still be loyal""
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party, at work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat
[Hook]
Treat 'em like a prostitute (mhm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my last example

[Verse 3]
Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles and you call her Rover
Next thing you know the ho starts to ill
She says ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours - who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Till I Collapse,rap,Eminem,2002,2447887,"{""Nate Dogg""}","[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me",440,en,en,en
O.P.P.,rap,Naughty By Nature,1991,353720,{},"[Intro: Treach]
Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)

Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory

Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it

Shot up my truck in East Atlanta
Want to set me up
Bbecause I tricked this nigga in Savannah
They put some money on my head
I had to move to Alabama
Started poppin' with my cousin
Mixing 'caine with Arm & Hammer
Somebody blooded my face badly
My last visit to the slammer
But they put me in that hole
Because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice
A couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
He pushed on, so I respect him
Before the fortune and the fame
Deep in the game, me and my gang
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
Two tear drops under my eye
Because I wish some days I could cry
But to lose my self-respect

Still some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker

Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock

How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside

Crying, laying in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family my mind is tender my
Daddy's invisible my Moms is Brenda, uh
If I survive I'ma grow into what
Society considers trash the rope is to us
That means I'm hanging myself by living
The noose is getting murdered, that or going to prison
My minds controlled 'fore I learned mind control
What you call living life I call dying slow
I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul freezing cold
Feeling like I was given life and if I take it at least I chose
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops

(Cause this is my pain)
Dear auntie I still feel your timeless sorrow
Before you died it's like your body was mine to borrow
Like I jumped in your physical shell
While you was going through miserable hell
Saying goodbye to tomorrow, everyday it makes me sad, angry, mad
How you were sent to Heaven's sacred path
Duct taped and gagged plus raped and stabbed
Body draped in blood what a fate to have
Such a pitiful end I'm popping Ritalin like they skittles cause
When I sleep I can feel it again and again and again it's difficult
Killing is the wickedest biblical sin
I'm talking about momma's identical twin
I see your face when I look at her
Her reminder of how I've been in the cold
Since 14 years old (swear to God)
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops

Alcoholic's child, raised off of sugar water
Hid it so you would just thought bout how good he was brought up
Coulda woulda oughta one track mind
They say man of many hats buys a hooker for a quarter
And now I'm writing a book and the hoods the author
Called the ""Obvious Poker Face The Look of Torture""
Teach you how to climb your way out that ditch then
Me all I need is this pen and thick skin
Being so bright could mean you lit then
Cause you start trying to figure out a figment
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops

So they had us back and forth to court in the months of the blizzard (Freezing)
My sneakers leaned the rubber was missing
No one on ones they always jumped me no brothers and sisters to hold me down
Along with headphones plugged into a cheap Walkman that ate tapes
Gun shots and me sleep walking I hate weights
A whole lot of crying police chalking that fate tape
Ambulance never on time they like a day late
My cousin ain't had to vacate my best friend since age eight
Sometimes I can't hold them I kid you not
Eyes get swollen holding on that tissue box
Somebody get a mop
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
'Till then all I'm hearing is wind and raindrops

[Hook - Novel]
Tear drops in the pillow of my bed
Still trying to keep my head up
Know you'd rather see me dead
And the raindrops keep on falling
I said they keep on falling
And they keep on falling

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the 'Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now, a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shawty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina—have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now, it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me
[Chorus]
Keep on saying, “Where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, huh, yeah
“Ayy, where you going, nigga?”
Hey, it ain't no telling, yeah
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” Going, nigga
Ayy, it ain't no telling (Yeah)
Can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, ugh

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning, ""J. Cole"", they used to say ""Jermaine""
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversing with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though
[Chorus]
Now, they yelling, “Where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, huh, yeah
“Ay, where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, yeah
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” Going, nigga
It ain't no telling, yeah
I can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom (Yeah), hello to the top, yeah

[Verse 3]
I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas ""Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque.""
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Ugh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream, and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport, I'm a fucking rap star

“Ayy, where you going, nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no telling, yeah

Lloyd Banks!!! (Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh!!!) Ha Ha!!!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It’s like a joke, he’s like a king, but he don’t rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room, he don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it
And you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ig-nor-ant, though you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
He's straight outta a neighborhood where niggas hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomachs ache while he's lounging in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay
Houses with a bigger gate, hounding him's a big mistake
He won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helping hand
Till he was sitting on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussing the illest players that's in the game
And he's riding with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em
G-Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stopping them

He's no magician man the kid does something out of nothing
So that niggas from his hood act like he owes him something
They talk crazy till they send niggas to where to buck him
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say ""nah, it's nothing""
He was gonna help 'em out but since they fronted fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thugging
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggas think he bugging
He bulletproof everything cause niggas try and buck him
Keeps two pistols on his hip I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggas say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch him slipping they creep in and he start bussing

No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and, oh, so cold, it's, oh, so cold
Oh, so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda, and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a–
-ssault and rape, then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
""Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?""
""He's rapin' me,"" she tries to scream, ""Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny""
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat

Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazin' skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back

Miracles,rap,Insane Clown Posse,2010,115752,{},"[Intro: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
We got a theory
You see, Mike, we got a theory
About magic, and miracles
That's right, that's right

[Verse 1: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
If magic is all we've ever known
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
The sun and the moon, and even Mars
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
UFOs, a river flows
Plant a little seed and nature grows
Niagara Falls and the pyramids
Everything you believed in as kids
Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen
[Chorus: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Music is all magic
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Pure motherfuckin' magic. Right?
This shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)

[Verse 2: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
Water, fire, air and dirt
Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
Miracles ain't nothing to lie
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
To witness that without explanation
Take a look at this fine creation
And enjoy it better with appreciation
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
To ignore the miracles of every day
And that's real
[Chorus: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles?) Shit's crazy

I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Whoo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I'll be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ha!

Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should've held back, but you throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty-pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha!

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
That's one to live or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
André, got to her station, here's my destination she got off the bus The conversation lingered in my head for hours took a shower Kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down

Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
A to the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie

Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, a but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money a than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ

Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, a right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
A come alive, y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

A come alive, y'all, a gimme what ya got

I say I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
A just blow your mind so a that you can't speak
A do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, a sing that song
A to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said ""I go by the name Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
A just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was twelve o'clock a one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling alright
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now, the group ya hear is called Phase 2
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a cutting the jams and making it freak
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down and make ya rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something, there's still one fact
That to have a party, got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping, you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase 2 a just a doing the do
Rocking ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
A come alive, girls, a get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on until the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
A come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
I say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat, beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
A so you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull""
A so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
But while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
Oh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend a two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby bubba, but we're still friends""

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
A with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]
I said, ""A Hank, a can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
A can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""A come on, make, m-make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go toot the horns and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from '66 to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you've heard
I didn't even bite, not a god**** word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all
A lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
A like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all
A beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well, like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
A like the Bar-Kays singing ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds I throw down, a they're played the most
Just a like my man, a Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
A get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
A to the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, a get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Bar-Kays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doing the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven
Don't ya know I went off?
I gotta run on down to the beat, you see
Getting right on down, making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was a really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine I was a right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
We're going on and on, and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on, and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A going on and on, and don't ya dare stop
A rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
They call me the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Outro: Master Gee]
I'm gonna move ya here, I'm gonna move ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind
I'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind
Said, just rock it to the east and move it to the west
Move it toward the lady you love-love the best
Master Gee, get it on
Taggin' all the girls, goin' down

What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
You know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up, get out and get something

Makes no difference whether a Benz or a Bentley

I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy
It's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web

I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude

And make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped

All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Ay, who got the politician's in they back pocket?
Pimp slap, pump that, give me that profit
When you make contact, give me that gossip
If you break contract, you'll be that hostage
They getting busy and the city is raw
Better deadbolt the door, it ain't safe no more

Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is, somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down, but now I'm back up
I'm about to act up, boy, you better back up
And when you see me set up shop, know to pack up
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Number one reason y'all should give rap up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kind of like W.E.B. Du Bois

Built like a tank, smokin' on dank

Go cop everything you ever heard by P. Crack

Buy a baseball bat, break a bootlegger leg
All I listen to is vets, you're fresh off the step
I'll come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step
I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show, I start it with a, ""Can I get a ho?""
And the hoes go retarded
The po-po tape off the stage for caution
It's bad lands, North Philly get it in, it's Crack man
Used to back spin, now I spend stacks and stacks
And Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard-earned raps
Damn, we making yens, pesos, euros, we representin'

Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame

[Verse 2]
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came, me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

[Interlude: Andre 3000]
Now who else want to fuck with Hollywood Cole?

[Verse 3]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying

I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe
Boy, check the resume, it's risky business in the A
And I been witness to this history, ever since the 10th grade
We went from rockin' braids to temp fades
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly
Wow, the Southern pride been known to shut it down
It ain't so country though, nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle
I'm Sergeant Slaughter, I keep my shit cooked to order in order
To satisfy my people in Georgia and 'cross the water
And across the border the eses are gettin' smarter
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas
If you follow, wink wink, no doubt, we don't speak
In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink
I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat
It's that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, O-U-T

A beehive 'cause now everybody buzzing around me
Could it be the way that the verse is sounding?
Came up on the Geto Boys and the Underground Kingz
Toys, I had a Brougham, call it ""Pretty Brown Thing""
Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining
Known to keep a bad bitch, no niggas beside me
Index this finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning
Not to flex but to protect my neck like the Wu-Tang
Self preservation is the rule when you do aim
Or get at something more sinister, you gotta be the finisher
Make it so the doctors they can't replenish him
Or bring him back to life, back to reality
Go on, get him some hoes, leave it alone
Triple OG status, A-town's very own

Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?

And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?

And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 2]
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', ""Join the armed forces!""
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle, yo

[Verse 3]
Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got ""God's Son"" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

Eleven hollows in my Glock: whom shall I fear?
And I ain't gotta tip-toe, I walk without a care

On top of my job, the heavyweight champ with the flow
It's flow like the ocean, open water, you're drowning, I will (Damn)
Four-pound him and seek him, heat him, then leave him stinking (Yuh)
Sharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him, I will— (Yeah)
Roll over your squad like I'm ""One-Punch"" Carr
You chumps, you best call General Motors, I will— (Ugh)
Take control of your soldiers, you won't miss 'em
'Til I toss em in the wok like chicken, General Tso, uh-oh!
[Verse 3: Willie the Kid]
I make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure (Yes)
Matter of fact I'm motivation to rap better (Yes)
I show niggas how to act, how to dress better
I stay fresh, more fitted caps than bad catchers (Woo)
I'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule
The gat, the strap, the gun, the tool
The motherfucking (Cannon!)
Other words, I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed (Yes)
Niggas ain't real as Will, 'cause I'm a (Cannon!)
And I handle well, pedal like Cannondale
And I got the 50-cal' mag, its a handheld (Cannon!)
I'm telling you niggas, I pop, put a shell in you niggas (Oh)
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas (Oh, oh)
I got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over
Blowing 'ghan by the quarter, weed odor in the Rover, nigga

[Verse 4: Detroit Red]
Yeah (Cannon!)
Detroit Red getting change like them white folks (Ha)
Dump it out the window of the Range with the rifle (Ha)
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle (Ha)
You better scurry when I pull the (Cannon! Ha)
Tracks burn the streets like a truck do the gas
I love head and caressing a voluptuous ass (What else?)
I ask ya baby mama is she up to the task
She like ""Damn Red, it's bigger than a (Cannon!)""
My attire makes the ladies say, ""Your man is too fly"" (What else?)
Imported oils from Iran and Dubai (What else?)
Get caught slipping with your mans, and you die
Where I'm from, niggas be quick to squeeze the (Cannon! Ha)
Detroit Red always got some shit for your ears
Show me love, but keep it moving, man, 'cause if you get near (Ha)
I'll say, ""Get off my dick"" and tell your bitch to come here
'Cause you sweating me and my DJ, Don (Cannon!)
[Verse 5: Juice]
Legs spread far out, you know how I'm standing
Yeah, I'm posted with the big homie (Cannon! Ha)
I got niggas who don't like rap loving our shit
We got niggas who was stuck on Pac bumping our shit
These niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately
A good batter; when they at the mound, it's gravy
Niggas salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella
Just a cigarillo filled with Tropicana
Yeah, Vic found that lick; now, we ain't smoking no more regular
Keep your mid-grade, I don't think you know no better
They loved ""In Da Trunk""; now, they wanna hear more shit
I play it modest, like, ""Nigga, that's some of our old shit""
Got niggas I ain't never met wanting to fight me
Got hoes that's in love, asking, ""Why you don't like me?""
Bitch, I'm married to the game, and I love my wifey
Stepping over competition, man, I love these Nikes (Yeah)
I'm hot, they fanning
Niggas try to copy my style like the (Cannon! Ha)
Don't try to compare—I'm in a league of my own
If I ain't listed at the top, nigga, the stats is wrong
All the data is off, your info ain't valid
Artist of the century, the competition ain't balanced
True, like Master P and his two brothers
Don't call it incest, but Juice the motherfucker, like— geah!

[Outro: DJ Drama]
This what I'ma do!
From here on out, you can call me Mr. Game Seven!
Oh, yeah!
That was just preseason!

One thing y'all know about me
I don't play, so just beware
You catch me up in V.I.P
Up in the club, that's my atmosphere
Because I got money to spend -- I keep getting it in
From the hood, so I don't play fair
And I'mma keep living it up, keep getting it up
Keep throwing it up until it all falls down

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Break the P's down to onions, money in abundance
I'm in the lower millions, I'm trying to get in the hundreds
Niggas' pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
You pay for somebody to protect you, so where your gun at?
Been there, done that; seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail, then run back
Singing the same sad song, my nigga -- one that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumbtack
Real hustler, probably sold a million and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice, but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull, give them a mum' wrap
When it's cold, I reside wherever the sun's at
Son's back, what?

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Top of the league, 3-piece suit or fatigues
All I got to do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
4 words describe me: ""Niggas can't fuck around""
Fish scale verses: prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keeping the case right
Apartment on the 4th floor, keeping the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keeping the safe right
First and the 15th is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like brake lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Was biting the whole day -- it's gonna be a great night

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Dice hitting the wall, decks getting shuffled
Nines getting wiped down, Tecs getting muffled
Perico in the plastic stacks in the duffel
Niggas coming through getting racks on the muscle
You asked me for money, I ain't ask you to hustle
The industry is hurt, they looking for the next Russell
The hip-hop cops outside waiting to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waiting to cut you
Niggas on the outside just want to abduct you
Dudes turned they back on you that you look up to
Keep throwing mine in the air, I got enough to
And I don't like spending my money, nigga...I love to

Too many Indians and no Chiefs
I pull out the pistol when I pre-mote peace
I'm the blueprint
I have your clothes lookin' like they was designed by bullet holes and shoe prints
When I bless a joint, it's like Spock
Came up in the spot and grabbed the beat by the pressure point
I got the Vulcan touch
I tell my bitch I'mma give up drinkin' when she give her emotions up
Too many enemies and no killers
Too many that hate snitchin' but know squealers
I get stacks (stacks)
I blam hard with the click-clack, that Antarctica wrist wrap
I spit crack for y'all niggas to get dope
Y'all gotta wait for the Transporter to get back
So who's the illest? What you talkin 'bout?
Die Hard like you Bruce Willis when I shoot to kill it
Too many hood guys, not enough good guys
The way you say pussy in plural, is puss-i
I don't be fuckin' around on that microphone
When I'm kickin' them flows on that microphone
The illest nigga that's holdin' that microphone
I put my heart and my soul in that microphone
I put it down on that (microphone)
Turn up the motherfuckin' sound on that microphone
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
But turn it down if you weak on that microphone
Lame niggas shouldn't speak on that microphone
My ultrasounds show me holdin' a microphone
That's on my momma, I was born with a microphone
Groupies love Crooked I on the microphone
Like James Brown, I'mma die on the microphone
Too many rappers need to leave this mic alone
They on the same bullshit that Mike was on
You're lookin' at the unseen, listenin' to the unheard
I kill your career with one word: Slaughterhouse
You're verbally flirtin' with murder, you got some nerve
I lift your skirt like a young perv - knock 'em out
We the mob, homie who need a job
Plus I'm so fly tell Derek Fisher I need a lob
Too many in this industry I need to rob
And if eatin niggas made you obese, I be The Blob
Fuck props, nigga this a different conquest
Listeners hear me spit and think it's a pissin' contest
I'm in it for power, if cowards try to stop me
They better off using a fishing pole to reel in the Loch Ness
Yes! I got a barrel that'll spot wussies
If you are what you eat, how come I'm not pussy?

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
You lil' niggas better come off that microphone
I'm educated but I'm dumb on that microphone
Don't even bother, you'll be done on that microphone
I'll turn a father to a son on that microphone
I'm a revolver in the slum on that microphone
And tell The Source I don't need no microphone
Too many critics tend to be silly
Too many frogs go ribbit but never leave lillies
I get it poppin' like a nine milli
Now I'm havin' a whale of a good time, I'm a Free Willy
Y'all lip singers take a pic, click, cheese really
Fans, who their man, I'm they quick pick easily
None of you kids spit evenly
You body my verse is like a thick bitch leavin' me
Ha ha, too many fantasies and no fame
Too many claimin' insanity and they so sane
Less than whack Scooby Snack lack flow game
Rappers everything I do be that crack cocaine
Your career is doobie wraps, slap Joe name
In any one of them verses, say hello to the hearses
Too many monkey see, monkey doers
I slaughter pigs on my tail like Punky Brewster
[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Niggas know I get it in on that microphone
Y'all don't know where to begin on that microphone
I don't see how y'all could win on that microphone
A pioneer, I set trends on that microphone
Decide who you wan' be on that microphone
I see a bunch of lil' me's, micro clones
Too many 20 milligram Vic's I'm on
Killed the web, it don't matter what site you on
Say his mouth always runnin' off
I tell 'em bridge or tunnel, give a fuck how I come across
All these wannabe tough guys, son is soft
Gun go off, havin' like a good show, just spun 'em off
Treat old-timers like fags who drop the soap
They mic got Alzheimer's, forgot that they was dope
Too many dogs, not enough barkin yet
Too many blueprints, not enough architects
Rhyme ain't started yet, still every bar's a mess
Fuck record sales or who the machine markets best
I'm the last muh'fucker that y'all should test
I'm the sharpshooter, you the nigga I target next
Too many frontin like y'all that fly
Reaching, 'cause we set the bar that high

Downfall,rap,Joe Budden,2011,49594,{},"[Intro]
Yall don't know me
Honestly, I can't say that I blame yall
I don't even really know myself
But, yall probably shouldn't know me

[Verse 1]
Last thing I'm tryna be is the good guy now
I ain't never gave a fuck, why should I now?
Like the world's interrupting my song, with an interlude
Can't y'all see I'm busy trying to balance out my chemical?
Finishing up, what y'all ain't even begin to do
When your back's against the ropes it's either him or you
Y'all ain't so important that my words are meant for you
When did ey'body become so sensual
Caught up in the he-say, she-say, blog sites
Him and her, broke up, WorldStar, Nahright
Dumb fans, they believe, everything that y'all write
Found out, friends fake, couldn't even facade right
Pressures on, won't fail, nigga got too much to prove
Would've been, lost it, but I got too much to lose
Say what you want about Joe, but I stood my ground
Bitch, I get it up myself, you just put it down
They say, I put my whole life on display to my dismay
Stop it, you're carrying on without logic
Let me tell you this about Joe
I only say what I want you to hear
You'll only see what I want to show
Crushing up the Percocet, chasing the high, Talli
I couldn't make this shit up if I tried
The forecast shows a downpour
Y'all just made God cry, praying for my Downfall
[Transition]
This shit I'm talking 'bout right here
Let me tell you niggas something
You can be anything in this world that you want
Except for my downfall

[Verse 2]
I'm a victim of society, circumstance or just feelings
Was a nigga victimized? Or just willing?
No blinds, no bags, just dealing
No foundation or floor plan, just building
Check it, nights bright, but the days dark
Covered in tattoos, but hate art
These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp
Staring at the finish line, looking for a way to start
I've been called everything, an extremist
Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
Anything a nigga do, a nigga mean it
And I won't let a person, place or thing come between it
An opportunist is how they paint me
But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me?
Still I feel like my problems are great
Shit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight
On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate
So he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight
I'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop
Even an outcast in my own group
What's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you
Everything that comes wit a spectacle?
If everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue
Tell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you
[Hook]
I'm sorry I ain't around more
Come up with me, or stay on the ground floor
I don't need shelter from the downpour
Y'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall
They tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no!
Can't be my downfall
They tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine
Can't be my downfall

[Verse 3]
No moment of clarity
The next fight showing is a rarity
Severity in me against my growin popularity
Rappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me
But can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me'
So y'all can go and throw your little pot shots
Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
I'm getting my head right, recollecting
Y'all looking for some website resurrection
Being that I got too much to lose
Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused
No longer amused, affected my loved ones
Now they startin' to bruise
And I don't want no parts of that abuse
Wouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes
That'll just eliminate any excuse
And why entertain em'?
Old me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em'
Been punched in the face
It was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38
I ain't want brunch to wait
I've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care
So next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there
I'm staring at the man in the mirror
But it ain't helping see the man any clearer
So I get M.I.A from around y'all
Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall
[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Tell me what am I to do
If I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due
But I gotta speak candidly
How the FUCK could you abandon me?!?
Wit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears
But it was obviously a disconnect
We turned that into a disrespect
Said she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy
So the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me
So I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own
But while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy
Did you ever think about what it would do to your home?
What's his name? Where's he live?
What is it he offers? What's he got to give?
And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs
I hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs
I was heated
But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it
Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
Mistreated, and kept it a big secret
Or are you just loose?
And I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse
Now that I refuse to believe, we life partners
Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
Can't use anything I ever gave you to bury me
You supposed to be the one to bury me
You wan' leave? Then goodbye
Think the grass look greener on the other side, but it's dye
