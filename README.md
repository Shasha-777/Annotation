# Annotation QA Analyst Project
# 🎧 Annotation QA Analyst Project – Song Lyrics Dataset

This project simulates the workflow of an **Annotation QA Analyst** in a music-focused environment like Spotify. Using the Genius Song Lyrics dataset, I built a complete annotation pipeline that includes tagging, quality assurance, and reviewer feedback loops.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective
To label and quality-check song lyrics based on:

- ✅ **Genre** verification
- 😊 **Sentiment** tagging
- 🚨 **Policy safety** (e.g., violence, explicit content)
- 🧠 **Theme** classification

This mirrors real-world human-in-the-loop systems used in moderation, recommendation engines, and content policy enforcement.

## 🛠️ Steps Completed

### ✅ 1. Dataset Preparation
- Extracted a clean 500-row sample from a 3GB Genius dataset
- Stored raw data and created annotation-ready CSV

### ✅ 2. Annotation Template
- Built `annotated_sample_template.csv` with additional columns:
  - `genre_verified`
  - `sentiment`
  - `policy_flag`
  - `theme`
  - `annotation_notes`

### ✅ 3. Annotation Guidelines
- Created detailed SOP in markdown format:
  - Definitions and use cases for each label
  - Edge case handling
  - Examples and reviewer clarity notes

### ✅ 4. Conflict Logging (Reviewer QA)
- Simulated disagreements between reviewers
- Logged cases in `reviewer_conflicts.csv`
- Included:
  - Ambiguous lyrics
  - Potential policy violations
  - Subjective interpretation conflicts

### ✅ 5. Feedback Loop
- Created `feedback_loop_notes.md` to:
  - Summarize conflict patterns
  - Propose improvements to guidelines
  - Document QA iteration process

## 🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ Human-in-the-loop quality assurance
- ✅ Annotation schema design
- ✅ SOP writing and documentation
- ✅ Policy moderation and ethical content analysis
- ✅ QA metrics: reviewer agreement, issue logging
- ✅ GitHub-based workflow and project packaging

---

## 🧭 Real-World Value

This project mirrors the work done by:
- Spotify Annotation QA Analysts
- Trust & Safety teams at Meta/YouTube
- Data curation teams at Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant
- Human-in-the-loop dataset teams in ML research

It highlights the ability to think like a **reviewer, analyst, and process designer** — not just a labeler.

---

## 💡 Future Extensions
- Add annotation automation using weak supervision or ML
- Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize trends
- Scale QA metrics (e.g., agreement rates, flagged ratio)
- Expand to multilingual lyrics
